  title: "Context graph dual tracking"
  summary: "Context graph must track where information is explicitly recorded (documents, decisions) AND where it is associated with individuals (expertise, tacit knowledge). Not OR - both dimensions simultaneously. Observation logs can infer expertise from behavioural patterns, complementing explicit declarations."
