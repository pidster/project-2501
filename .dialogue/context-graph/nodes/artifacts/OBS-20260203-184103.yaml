  title: "Task ID collision risk in fork-based workflows"
  summary: "Exploring multi-contributor workflow reveals that task ID collisions can occur across: (1) branches within same repo, (2) forks of same repo, (3) upstream vs forks. Current next-id.sh generates IDs from local files only, with no awareness of remote state or fork topology. The warning in auto-approve-skills.sh only checks origin/main, not fork relationships."
