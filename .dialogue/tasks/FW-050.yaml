title: "Fix auto team mode chicken-and-egg user registration bug"

description: |
  Auto team mode cannot transition from solo to team because new users are only registered in team mode, but 2+ registered users are needed to trigger team mode. This creates a circular dependency where auto mode stays stuck in solo forever.
objective: "Auto mode should register users regardless, then use user count only for feature gating (sync reminders, etc.)"
rationale: |
  Discovered when user amv was not registered despite working in repo. See OBS-20260203-180004.
