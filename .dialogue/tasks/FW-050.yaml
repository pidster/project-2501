description: |
  Auto team mode cannot transition from solo to team because new users are only registered in team mode, but 2+ registered users are needed to trigger team mode. This creates a circular dependency where auto mode stays stuck in solo forever.
objective: "Auto mode should register users regardless, then use user count only for feature gating (sync reminders, etc.)"
rationale: |
  Discovered when user amv was not registered despite working in repo. See OBS-20260203-180004.

  Created 03 February 2026.

  Completed 03 February 2026:
  - session-start-guided.sh: Read raw config (auto/solo/team) before resolution
  - session-start-guided.sh: Register users if config != solo (enables auto mode counting)
  - detect-team-mode.sh: Promote auto → team permanently when 2+ users detected
  - Design decision logged: DEC-20260203-190913 (no team→solo transition)
