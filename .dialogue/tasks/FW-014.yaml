description: |
  Design and implement mechanism for orchestrator to hand off process
  definitions to subagents for execution.

  Considerations:
  - How process definition travels (inline vs file reference)
  - Context passing (what else subagent needs)
  - Task tool integration
  - Subagent type selection

objective: "Orchestrator can spawn subagent with process definition"
rationale: "Enables orchestrator-composed, subagent-executed pattern"

  19 January 2026: COMPLETED
  - Task tool invocation pattern documented in process-executor.md
  - ProcessInstance passes definition via WELL_KNOWN (path) or DYNAMIC (inline)
  - Context passing via instance.context (inputs, parameters, test_mode)
  - Successfully tested: orchestrator invoked executor via Task tool
