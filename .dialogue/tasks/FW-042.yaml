description: |
  Extend phase readiness assessment to provide DEFER remediation guidance based on phase information composition. High-tacit phases should recommend dialogue-based remediation; low-tacit phases should recommend artifact/formal remediation. Include restart point identification.
rationale: |
  Information composition (tacit %) determines appropriate remediation strategy - tacit gaps need human dialogue, formal gaps can be addressed through documentation.

  Design exploration 22 January 2026:

  Two-factor model for DEFER remediation:

  Factor 1: Phase Tacit Percentage
  - Phase 1 (75%): Primarily dialogue-based remediation
  - Phase 2 (55%): Dialogue-dominant, some artifact review
  - Phase 3 (50%): Balanced dialogue + artifact
  - Phase 4 (40%): Balanced, slightly artifact-weighted
  - Phase 5 (35%): Artifact-dominant, some pairing
  - Phase 6-7 (30%): Primarily artifact/process review

  Factor 2: Gap Dimension
  - documentation_readiness → Formal gaps → Artifact remediation
  - knowledge_transfer_readiness → Tacit gaps → Dialogue remediation
  - stakeholder_readiness → Alignment gaps → Facilitation remediation
  - technical_readiness → Dependency gaps → Technical resolution

  Key insight: Same dimension requires different remediation based on phase.
  E.g., documentation gap in Phase 1 = "haven't articulated vision" (needs dialogue)
  vs Phase 6 = "test specs incomplete" (needs artifact work).

  Proposed output structure:
  ```yaml
  defer_guidance:
    primary_gap: <dimension>
    phase_tacit_percentage: <from lookup>
    recommended_approach: DIALOGUE | MIXED | ARTIFACT
    specific_actions: [list of recommended activities]
    restart_point:
      phase: <number>
      activity: <description>
      artifact: <if applicable>
  ```

  Implementation approach:
  1. Add phase tacit % lookup table to script
  2. Identify lowest-scoring dimension(s) as primary gap
  3. Cross-reference phase tacit % with gap type
  4. Generate recommended_approach and specific_actions
  5. Suggest restart_point based on gap origin
