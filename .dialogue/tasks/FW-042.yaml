type: CAPABILITY
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  Extend phase readiness assessment to provide DEFER remediation guidance based on phase information composition. High-tacit phases should recommend dialogue-based remediation; low-tacit phases should recommend artifact/formal remediation. Include restart point identification.
rationale: |
  Information composition (tacit %) determines appropriate remediation strategy - tacit gaps need human dialogue, formal gaps can be addressed through documentation.
