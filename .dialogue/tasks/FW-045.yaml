type: RESEARCH
priority: MEDIUM
description: |
  Investigate using the Claude Code SDK (Claude Agent SDK) as an implementation approach for claude-plugin-rev (Revolution mode). This would be an alternative packaging model to the current plugin-based delivery.

  Research areas:
  - SDK capabilities and limitations
  - Tool definition and integration patterns
  - Distribution and installation model
  - Context and conversation management
  - Comparison with plugin-based approach
objective: "Determine feasibility and approach for SDK-based Revolution mode delivery"
rationale: |
  The Claude Code SDK may offer deployment flexibility and tighter integration options that complement or improve upon plugin-based delivery for the production-ready Revolution mode.
