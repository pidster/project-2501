title: Fix shell script errors identified in code review
status: READY
type: BUG
priority: HIGH

description: |
  Code review of all 37 shell scripts identified 3 issues across 2 scripts.
  These should be fixed to improve robustness and prevent potential failures.

objective: |
  All identified script issues are resolved with proper error handling,
  quoting, and JSON escaping.

sub_items:
  - id: FW-049.1
    title: "Fix unquoted variables in session-start.sh"
    status: PENDING
    description: |
      File: claude-plugin-evo/hooks/scripts/session-start.sh
      Lines: 48, 52
      Issue: Variables $id and $title used without proper escaping in string
      concatenation. Could fail on titles with spaces or special characters.
      Severity: High

  - id: FW-049.2
    title: "Fix fragile heredoc error handling in session-start-guided.sh"
    status: PENDING
    description: |
      File: claude-plugin-evo/hooks/scripts/session-start-guided.sh
      Lines: 152, 180
      Issue: Using `read -r -d '' ... || true` suppresses real errors.
      The pattern is fragile with set -euo pipefail.
      Severity: Medium

  - id: FW-049.3
    title: "Fix JSON injection vulnerability in task-summary.sh"
    status: PENDING
    description: |
      File: claude-plugin-evo/skills/dialogue-manage-tasks/scripts/task-summary.sh
      Line: 162
      Issue: Variables $id, $title, $priority embedded directly in JSON without
      escaping. Task titles containing quotes would produce invalid JSON.
      Severity: Medium

rationale: |
  Script robustness is essential for reliable framework operation.
  These issues were identified during systematic code review of all scripts.

notes: |
  Created 3 February 2026:
  - Identified via comprehensive script analysis
  - 37 scripts examined, 3 issues found in 2 scripts
  - Most scripts demonstrate excellent practices
