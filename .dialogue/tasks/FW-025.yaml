description: |
  Create explicit linkage between the claude-plugin-evo plugin and the
  dialogue-framework-evolution.md document.

  ## Relationship Model

  Unidirectional flow: concepts → docs → build → plugin

  The plugin references 'Evolution' as a documentation concept only.
  The evolution document points toward the plugin as a build output.
  The plugin does not back-reference the evolution document.

  ## Files

  - Plugin: claude-plugin-evo/
  - Evolution document: dialogue-framework-evolution.md (project root)

  ## Tasks

  1. Review dialogue-framework-evolution.md content and purpose
  2. Add forward reference from evolution doc to plugin (as build output)
  3. Ensure plugin references 'Evolution' concept in appropriate documentation
  4. Verify unidirectional relationship is clear and navigable

objective: "Clear, unidirectional relationship: evolution doc → plugin"
rationale: |
  The plugin is a build output of the framework development process.
  The evolution document captures the development trajectory and should
  point forward to its outputs. The plugin references concepts but doesn't
  back-reference source documents.
