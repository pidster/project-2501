type: CAPABILITY
phase: 2
priority: HIGH
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 2 guidance in framework-manual.md and AI configuration.

  REVISED APPROACH: Same principle as SH-008/SH-009.

  Tasks:
  1. Update framework-manual.md with Phase 2 operational guidance:
     - Document types (project plan, risk register, resource allocation, governance)
     - Information composition (55% tacit, 10% emergent, 35% formal)
     - Planning spans most of project lifecycle and refines iteratively
     - Collaboration patterns shift as planning becomes more formal
  2. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 2 behaviour

  Note: Planning is unique—it bridges Initiation's tacit-heavy work to
  Analysis's balanced work, and spans most of project lifecycle.
objective: "Phase 2 guidance operationalised in framework-manual.md and AI config"
rationale: |
  Completes Phase 1-2 operational guidance.
  Planning is interesting because patterns shift over time within the phase.
