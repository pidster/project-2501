  Create comprehensive catalogue of information artefacts mapped to SDLC phases.

  EXPANDED SCOPE (26 Jan):
  - Identify ALL baseline project knowledge types (not just vision/objectives)
  - Map each artefact type to its primary phase(s)
  - Define which artefacts can have sensible defaults
  - Enable visualisation as:
    * Information tree (hierarchical view)
    * DAG with directional force aligned to SDLC phase order
  - Support forward consistency checking (change to artefact triggers re-analysis)

  ARTEFACT CATEGORIES BY PHASE:
  Phase 1 (Initiation): Vision, objectives, stakeholders, constraints, success criteria
  Phase 2 (Planning): Scope, WBS, schedule, resources, risks, principles
  Phase 3 (Requirements): Requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria
  Phase 4 (Design): Architecture patterns, interfaces, security model, data model
  Phase 5 (Implementation): Coding standards, design patterns, git strategy, logging, error handling
  Phase 6 (Testing): Test strategy, coverage goals, test environments
  Phase 7 (Operations): Deployment strategy, monitoring, runbooks, SLAs

  CROSS-PHASE ARTEFACTS:
  - Principles (Phase 2 → all subsequent phases)
  - Constraints (Phase 1 → all phases)
  - Security requirements (Phase 4 → 5, 6, 7)

objective: "Comprehensive catalogue of project knowledge types with phase mapping, defaults, and DAG visualisation support"
rationale: |
  Baseline project knowledge (coding standards, git strategy, logging approach, etc.) is typically "good practice" but overlooked. Providing defaults surfaces these for conscious decision. Phase mapping enables:
  - Discovery dialogue to ask relevant questions per phase
  - DAG visualisation showing information flow through SDLC
  - Forward consistency checking when artefacts change

  Created 22 January 2026.

  26 January - Scope expanded:
  - From "document formats" to "comprehensive knowledge catalogue"
  - Added phase mapping for tree/DAG visualisation
  - Added defaults concept for overlooked best practices
  - Connected to DOC-004 discovery dialogue work
  - THEORY TREE: THY documents per phase form implied hierarchy over context graph
    * Each phase has associated theories capturing "why" understanding
    * Theories derive from/build upon earlier phase theories
    * Forward consistency: changes to THY-Pn trigger re-analysis of THY-P(n+1..7)
