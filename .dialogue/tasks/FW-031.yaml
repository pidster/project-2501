description: |
  Add CONTRADICTS and RISKS edge types to context graph traceability model. Deferred from initial FW-028 implementation to reduce complexity.
objective: "Support contradiction detection and risk tracking in traceability graph"
rationale: |
  Negative edges valuable but not essential for initial implementation. Spawned from FW-028 design discussion.

  Created 21 January 2026.

  26 January 2026: Unblocked - FW-028 completed. Moved to READY.

  28 January 2026: Implemented negative traceability edges.

  Implementation summary:
  - Schema (schema_context-graph.md):
    - Added CONTRADICTS and RISKS to traceability edge types table
    - Added ContraddictsEdgeMetadata (strength, resolution_status, notes)
    - Added RisksEdgeMetadata (severity, likelihood, mitigation_status, mitigation_plan)
    - Added consistency rules 11-13 for new edge types
    - Added Cypher query examples for contradiction/risk traversal
    - Updated validation status section

  - Query script (graph-trace.sh):
    - Added `contradicts <id>` query
    - Added `risks <id>` query
    - Added `conflicted` query (finds nodes with both VALIDATES and CONTRADICTS)
    - Added `threatened` query (finds nodes with RISKS edges)

  All queries tested and working.
