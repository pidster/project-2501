description: |
  Verify that the plugin directory is completely standalone and has no
  external references required during execution.

  Permitted:
  - Link URLs to online documentation
  - References to Claude Code built-in environment variables

  Not permitted:
  - References to files outside plugin/ that are needed at runtime
  - Dependencies on concepts/, implementation/, research/, papers/
  - Paths that assume the full project-2501 repository structure

  Tasks:
  1. Scan all files in plugin/ for file path references
  2. Identify any references to directories outside plugin/
  3. For each external reference, determine if it's:
     - A documentation/explanatory reference (OK)
     - A runtime dependency (NOT OK - must be resolved)
  4. Check scripts for hardcoded paths outside plugin/
  5. Verify config templates use only relative paths or env vars
  6. Document findings and fix any issues found

  Search patterns:
  - "../" references in markdown and scripts
  - Absolute paths
  - References to concepts/, implementation/, research/, papers/
  - File reads/includes in shell scripts

objective: "Plugin directory can be deployed independently without the framework source"
rationale: |
  The plugin is the deployable artifact (Tier 2 per schema_deployment-model.md).
  It must work when copied to other projects without access to framework
  source directories (Tier 1). Runtime dependencies on external files would
  break standalone deployment.

  COMPLETED 20 January 2026 (as part of FW-019):

  Verification results:
  1. Scanned all files in plugin/ for external references
  2. Found only 3 external references, all documentation links:
     - plugin/references/schema_process-definition.md → ../concepts/ (doc links)
     - plugin/processes/README.md → ../../implementation/ (doc link)
  3. No runtime dependencies found:
     - No scripts reference external directories
     - No hardcoded paths outside plugin/
     - All config uses env vars (CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT)

  Conclusion: Plugin directory is standalone and can be deployed independently.
