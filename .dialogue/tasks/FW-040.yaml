description: |
  Track active users in .dialogue files. Gate framework functionality based on user count: solo mode (simplified, relaxed sync) vs multi-user mode (full sync checks, pull reminders, transactive memory). Define what differs between modes.
objective: "Right-size framework overhead based on team context"
rationale: |
  Solo users don't need collaboration overhead; multi-user needs full sync machinery
