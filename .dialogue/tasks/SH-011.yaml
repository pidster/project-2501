description: |
  Operationalise Phase 2 capability flows in framework-manual.md and AI configuration.

  REVISED APPROACH: Same principle as SH-008/SH-009.

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 2 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-2.1: Resource Planning
     - PROC-2.2: Risk Assessment
     - PROC-2.3: Schedule Development
     - PROC-2.4: Governance Structure

  2. For each process, specify capability instances, functional roles, patterns
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 2 capability flows

  Key insight from C-3: Planning spans most of project and refines iteratively.
  Capability flows should show:
  - Initial Planning (higher uncertainty, more Elicit/Synthesise)
  - Refinement cycles (as Requirements/Design provide detail)
  - Pattern shifts as planning becomes more formal over time
objective: "Phase 2 capability flows operationalised in framework-manual.md and AI config"
rationale: |
  Companion to SH-010. Planning is unique in spanning multiple phases;
  operationalised guidance must show how patterns shift over time.

notes: |
  Created 14 January 2026 from Phase 1-2 analysis.
  REVISED 14 January 2026: Changed from "create exemplar" to "operationalise flows".
  Most complex due to Planning's temporal span.

  COMPLETED 20 January 2026 as part of SH-018:
  - Created PROC-2.1 (Scope Definition) - plugin/processes/process-scope-definition.yaml
  - Created PROC-2.2 (Risk Assessment) - plugin/processes/process-risk-assessment.yaml
  - Created PROC-2.3 (Resource Planning) - plugin/processes/process-resource-planning.yaml
  - Created PROC-2.4 (Schedule Development) - plugin/processes/process-schedule-development.yaml
  - All with QUICK/FULL modes, Human-Only steps, escalation triggers
  - Pattern evolution documented in phase2-planning.md rules
