description: |
  Rename the 'plugin' directory to 'claude-plugin-evo' and update all
  references throughout the codebase.

  Tasks:
  1. Rename plugin/ to claude-plugin-evo/
  2. Update all internal references:
     - Process definition references to rules files
     - Schema documentation paths
     - CLAUDE.md references
     - Framework manual references
     - Cross-references in concept documents
  3. Update any relative paths in YAML files
  4. Verify no broken references remain
  5. Update WHAT_IS_THIS.md if needed

  Files likely affected:
  - All plugin/processes/*.yaml (references section)
  - implementation/schema_process-definition.md
  - implementation/framework-manual-source.md
  - .claude/CLAUDE.md
  - concepts/*.md (any plugin/ references)

objective: "Plugin directory renamed with all references updated"
rationale: |
  The name 'claude-plugin-evo' better reflects the purpose and evolution
  of this component as a Claude Code plugin implementation.

notes: |
  COMPLETED 20 January 2026:

  1. Verified plugin directory standalone (FW-021 incorporated):
     - Only documentation links to external directories (permitted)
     - No runtime dependencies on concepts/, implementation/, etc.

  2. Renamed plugin/ to claude-plugin-evo/ using git mv

  3. Updated all active file references:
     - .claude/CLAUDE.md (2 references)
     - concepts/concept_collaboration-patterns.md (1 reference)
     - implementation/schema_process-definition.md (6 references)
     - implementation/schema_process-instance.md (2 references)
     - implementation/schema_tasks.md (2 references)
     - claude-plugin-evo/README.md (2 references)
     - claude-plugin-evo/skills/dialogue-resolve-reference/SKILL.md (2 references)
     - claude-plugin-evo/skills/dialogue-resolve-reference/scripts/resolve-reference.sh (1 reference)
     - claude-plugin-evo/references/schema_process-definition.md (6 references)
     - claude-plugin-evo/references/schema_process-instance.md (2 references)
     - claude-plugin-evo/agents/process-executor.md (2 references)
     - claude-plugin-evo/processes/README.md (1 reference)

  4. Historical references in .dialogue/ logs and tasks left unchanged:
     - These document what existed at the time of execution
     - Changing them would be rewriting history
