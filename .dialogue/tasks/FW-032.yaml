description: |
  After FW-023 assessment infrastructure is implemented and tested, revisit soft gate integration for phase transitions. Soft gates capture user decision to proceed at risk, enabling conscious information debt tracking per C-8 principles.
objective: "Determine which transitions need soft gates to capture proceed-at-risk decisions"
rationale: |
  Soft gates are the mechanism for making information debt conscious and tracked. Further analysis needed after experimentation with assessment infrastructure.

  26 January 2026: Unblocked - FW-023 completed. Moved to READY.

  Completed 26 January 2026:
  - Analysed phase transitions for soft gate requirements
  - Decision: Balanced approach - gate 1→2, 2→3, 3→4 (tacit-heavy transitions)
  - 4→5 optional; 5→6, 6→7 not required (tight feedback loops)
  - Added "Phase Transition Gates" section to framework-manual.md
  - Documents soft gate outcomes (PROCEED, PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION, DEFER)
  - Explains why soft gates over hard gates (context-dependent, human judgement)
