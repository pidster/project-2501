  Created 26 January 2026.

  26 January - Verification completed:

  Files using OLD format (<dialogue-signals>):
  - hooks/scripts/user-prompt-submit.sh - SUPERSEDED (marked in file header)
  - tests/results/*.yaml - Historical test results, retain as baseline
  - tests/hook-effectiveness-test.md - Documents old vs new comparison

  Files using NEW format (<dialogue-instruction>):
  - hooks/scripts/user-prompt-submit-guided.sh - Active, correctly migrated

  Migration action:
  - Updated README.md to document new instruction-based approach
  - Changed output format documentation from signals to directives
  - Updated example instructions and interpretation guidance

  No further migration needed - deprecated files are marked, test files are
  historical records.
