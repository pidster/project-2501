title: "Remove references to old log file locations"
status: COMPLETED
created: "2026-01-20T20:20:00Z"
updated: "2026-01-20T20:30:00Z"
type: CLEANUP
priority: LOW
description: |
  Check for and remove any references to the old consolidated log files:
  - .dialogue/logs/decisions.yaml
  - .dialogue/logs/observations.yaml

  These have been replaced by per-entry files in:
  - .dialogue/logs/decisions/DEC-*.yaml
  - .dialogue/logs/observations/OBS-*.yaml

  Tasks:
  1. Search codebase for references to old paths
  2. Update any documentation referencing old structure
  3. Update any skills or commands that reference old paths
  4. Verify schema documentation reflects current structure

  Search locations:
  - .claude/ (skills, commands, agents)
  - plugin/ (processes, rules, references)
  - implementation/ (schemas, manual)
  - concepts/ (if any operational references)

objective: "No references to deprecated log file locations remain"
rationale: |
  Log structure changed from single consolidated files to per-entry files
  for better merge handling and granularity. Old references could cause
  confusion or errors.
