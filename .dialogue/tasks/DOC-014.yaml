description: |
  Refocus framework-manual.md on how to USE the framework (operational guidance for practitioners). Move engineering/implementation details to a separate engineering manual in implementation/.
objective: "framework-manual.md is practitioner-focused; engineering details live separately"
rationale: |
  Current manual mixes usage guidance with framework engineering details, making it harder for practitioners to find what they need

  Created 26 January 2026.

  Questions to clarify (from prior discussion not found in transcripts):
  1. What should stay in the usage-focused framework-manual.md?
  2. What should move to the engineering-focused document?
  3. Any particular structure or audience distinction?

  Known context:
  - implementation/framework-engineering-manual-source.md already exists (renamed from framework-manual-source.md)
  - Current framework-manual.md (in plugin/references/) mixes operational guidance with engineering details
  - Target audiences: practitioners (usage) vs framework developers (engineering)
