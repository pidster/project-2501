description: |
  Refocus framework-manual.md on how to USE the framework (operational guidance for practitioners). Move engineering/implementation details to a separate engineering manual in implementation/.
objective: "framework-manual.md is practitioner-focused; engineering details live separately"
rationale: |
  Current manual mixes usage guidance with framework engineering details, making it harder for practitioners to find what they need

  Created 26 January 2026.

  Completed 3 February 2026.

  Split completed:
  - Usage Manual (claude-plugin-evo/references/framework-manual.md): 470 lines
    - Quick Reference, Skill Usage, Team Modes, Dialogue Protocol
    - Phase 1 Guidance, Common Pitfalls
  - Engineering Manual (implementation/framework-engineering-manual-source.md): 578 lines
    - Core Constraints (C1-C4), Process Specification Schema
    - ID Conventions, Work Coordination, Process Architect Workflow
    - Information Architecture, Evidential Standards, Document Classification

  Decisions:
  - Quick Reference stays in usage manual only (not duplicated)
  - Usage manual has no cross-reference to engineering manual (plugin deploys standalone)
  - Engineering manual cross-references usage manual for skill commands
