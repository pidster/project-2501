description: |
  Define contract for how subagents execute process definitions.

  Must specify:
  - How subagent interprets process definition
  - Step execution sequence
  - Progress logging requirements
  - Completion/failure signalling
  - What gets returned to orchestrator

objective: "Clear contract for subagent execution behaviour"
rationale: "Enables consistent, auditable subagent execution"

  19 January 2026: COMPLETED
  - process-executor.md defines complete execution contract
  - Step execution: load → validate (V1-V8) → entry criteria → execute → exit criteria
  - Progress logging: DEC-*/OBS-* entries, control_flow_events
  - Completion signalling: outcome object with execution_success + process_result
  - Failure handling: partial results, error recovery, BLOCK/RETURN/DEFER
