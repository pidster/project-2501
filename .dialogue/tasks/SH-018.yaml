status: COMPLETED

type: CAPABILITY
phase: 2
priority: HIGH
description: |
  Operationalise Phase 2 (Planning) guidance and capability flows.

  Phase characteristics:
  - Information composition: 35% formal, 55% tacit, 10% emergent
  - Key capabilities: Analyse, Synthesise, Decide, Preserve
  - Collaboration patterns: Human-Led, Partnership
  - Key outputs: Project plan, risk register, resource allocation, governance

  Tasks:
  1. Define Phase 2 processes in framework-manual.md:
     - PROC-2.1: Scope Definition
     - PROC-2.2: Risk Assessment
     - PROC-2.3: Resource Planning
     - PROC-2.4: Schedule Development
  2. Specify capability instances, roles, patterns, triggers
  3. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 2 behaviour

  Key insight: Planning spans most of project lifecycle and refines iteratively.
  Collaboration patterns shift as planning becomes more formal over time.

objective: "Phase 2 guidance and capability flows operationalised"
rationale: |
  Planning bridges Initiation's tacit-heavy work to Analysis's balanced work.
  Unique phase where patterns evolve within the phase itself.

  Created 19 January 2026 - consolidated from SH-010 and SH-011.

  COMPLETED 20 January 2026:
  - Created PROC-2.1 (Scope Definition)
  - Created PROC-2.2 (Risk Assessment)
  - Created PROC-2.3 (Resource Planning)
  - Created PROC-2.4 (Schedule Development)
  - Created plugin/rules/phase2-planning.md for AI behaviour
  - All processes follow QUICK/FULL modes per PRI-001
  - Human-Only steps clearly demarcated for organisational decisions
  - Pattern evolution within phase documented in rules
