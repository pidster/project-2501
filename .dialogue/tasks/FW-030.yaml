description: |
  Determine whether a TaskEnd event should be platform-level (Claude Code) or framework-level (Dialogue Framework). Explore what defines task boundaries and implementation options.
objective: "Clarify architectural layer for task completion events"
rationale: |
  Current hooks operate at tool or session level; no hook for logical work unit completion

  Created 21 January 2026.

  Key questions to explore:
  - What defines a "task" boundary? (TodoWrite, .dialogue/tasks status, explicit declaration)
  - Platform vs framework: should Claude Code provide TaskEnd, or can framework simulate via PostToolUse?
  - If framework-level: hook on task status change to COMPLETED/CANCELLED
  - If platform-level: would need to propose to Claude Code team

  Resolution 21 January 2026:
  - Chose Option 5: Skill guidance rather than hooks
  - Updated log-observation, log-decision, and manage-tasks skills
  - Added "Sharing" section with instruction to commit/push immediately
  - Simpler than hooks, works now, explicit in skill contract
  - Trade-off: relies on Claude following instructions (acceptable)
