description: |
  Investigate creating a GitHub Copilot flavour of the Dialogue Framework using the Copilot CLI SDK. This would extend the framework's reach beyond Claude Code to support teams using GitHub Copilot.

  Research areas:
  - Copilot CLI SDK capabilities and extension points
  - Command and conversation model differences
  - Portability of framework components
  - Shared vs platform-specific implementation
  - Distribution through GitHub/npm ecosystem
objective: "Determine feasibility of a Copilot-based Dialogue Framework flavour"
rationale: |
  Supporting multiple AI coding assistants would increase framework adoption and provide comparative insights for framework design. The core framework concepts are model-agnostic.
