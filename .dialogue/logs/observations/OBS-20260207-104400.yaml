subject: "Context graph minimum requirements as onboarding driver"
value: "Defining explicit minimum context graph requirements for the Process Orchestrator serves triple duty: (1) prerequisites for Orchestrator functionality — what nodes, edges, and coverage it needs to orchestrate a build cycle; (2) onboarding curriculum — the Dialogue Agent in AI-Led mode guides users through populating these elements, giving onboarding a finite, concrete sequence; (3) structural transition signal — graph reaching sufficient content for orchestration marks the natural shift from AI-Led toward Partnership. This removes the need for heuristic transition signals and makes the collaboration pattern trajectory mechanistic. The requirements could live as a schema in the Orchestrator spec or as a reference document."
