subject: "Collaboration pattern trajectory"
value: "The Dialogue Agent collaboration pattern is not fixed — it follows a trajectory from AI-Led (4) through Partnership (3) to Human-Led (2) as user gains framework competency. Progressive disclosure extends beyond vocabulary to who leads the work. Current fixed Human-Led assignment only describes the end state. Transition signals: context graph density, user-initiated captures, reduced guidance-seeking, vocabulary adoption. Patterns may need to be understood as trajectories, not static assignments."
