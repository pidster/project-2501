actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "CLAUDE.md bootstrap approach"
outcome: "Minimal CLAUDE.md (55 lines) with guided hooks providing operating instructions"
rationale: "Clean separation: CLAUDE.md for identity/conventions/escalation, hooks for operating instructions, plugin for full guidance"
context: "FW-038 analysis showed 386-line CLAUDE.md duplicated plugin content; guided hooks inject instructions deterministically"
tags: ["FW-038", "bootstrap", "hooks"]
