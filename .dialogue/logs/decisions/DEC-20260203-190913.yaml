actor: "human:amv"
subject: "Auto mode promotes to team permanently"
outcome: "When auto mode detects 2+ users, write team_mode: team to config"
rationale: "Once multiple team members have worked on a project, that history is permanent - artifacts, decisions, observations all reflect multi-author work. There is no logical transition from team back to solo."
context: "FW-050 fix design; considering whether auto should stay dynamic or lock in team mode"
