subject: "Actor-concept integration approach"
outcome: "Extended I-3 (Naur-Wegner Integration) rather than creating new integration document"
rationale: "I-3 already establishes conversation as dual mechanism for theory-building and TMS; functional roles operationalise this existing framework rather than requiring new conceptual infrastructure"
context: "Gap identified: C-4 defines actor types, C-5 defines patterns, but neither defines functional roles. Options: create I-4, extend C-4, or extend I-3. Chose I-3 because conversation-as-TMS is the conceptual foundation for roles."

subject: "Phase 1 draft disposition"
outcome: "Archive draft; detailed document schemas deferred to future work"
rationale: "Draft served its purpose: insights absorbed into framework-manual.md and AI config. Detailed document type schemas are speculative and untested—defer formalisation until practical experience validates need."

subject: "Phase 1 guidance placement"
outcome: "Removed rules file; guidance stays in framework-manual.md and skills"
rationale: "Rules path-matching is for file-scoped concerns; phase guidance is work-type-scoped. Skills and framework-manual.md are correct locations."
context: "Phase-specific guidance needs activation by work context, not file paths"

type: TACTICAL
actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "FW-008 scope clarification"
outcome: "Narrow scope to human-user-interface interaction and activity orchestration only"
rationale: "Avoid premature architectural commitments; actors may still emerge from configuration within phases; orchestration is about routing human input, not replacing emergent actor model"
context: "User clarified FW-008 intent after initial over-broad capture"

type: TACTICAL
actor: "ai:claude"
subject: "Hooks orchestration assessment"
outcome: "Hooks insufficient for orchestration; layered approach required"
rationale: "Hooks run in parallel, stateless, no inter-hook communication—cannot provide routing/state machine"
context: "FW-009 investigation complete: 10 hook events documented, prompt-based hooks promising for intelligent decisions but not orchestration itself"

actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Pause FW-008 to extend C-3 with retrograde navigation"
outcome: "Extend C-3 (Seven-Phase SDLC) with retrograde step concept before continuing orchestrator research"
rationale: "Emergent information triggering retrograde steps is a process outcome that the framework should enable navigation of, not just trace"
context: "Insight from FW-008 thought experiment; phases have implied linearity but retrograde steps are valid process outcomes"

actor: "ai:claude"
subject: "C-3 retrograde navigation extension"
outcome: "Extended C-3 with retrograde navigation section: phases as character not location, navigation vs tracing, tooling implications"
rationale: "Backward events are valid process outcomes that framework should help navigate, not just trace; addresses gap where current framing treats retrograde steps negatively"
context: "User insight OBS-20260115-091213: emergent information triggers retrograde steps as process outcome; linear feature vectors cause change-handling debates"

actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Subagent process architecture"
outcome: "Hybrid model: standalone process definitions + generic process-executor agent + Task tool invocation"
rationale: "Best user experience - user doesn't need to know framework internals; Claude handles process selection and can check with user if uncertain"

subject: "User-facing process language"
outcome: "Claude must never expose process IDs to users; must explain intent in plain English"
rationale: "Framework internals are implementation details; users should understand what will happen, not which process definition is being invoked"

type: DESIGN
actor: "human:pidster"
subject: "Plugin self-containment architecture"
outcome: "Plugin must be independently deployable with all operational content embedded; host project produces the plugin as a build artifact"
rationale: "Plugin portability requires no external dependencies on host project files. The framework manual and operational content are distilled/copied from source (implementation/, concepts/) into plugin/references/. External links to build artefacts are elided. This enables the plugin to be deployed to other projects without requiring the full framework development repository."
context: "Triggered by need for plugin to operate correctly without external links"

outcome: "Changed document type from WRK (Working) to NOT (Note); renamed /create-working to /create-note"

outcome: "Always use prompt evaluation with loop guard; defer fast-path optimisation"
