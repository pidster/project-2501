      Create schema for information references used in capability flow specifications.
      Should define how to reference documents, decisions, observations, and external sources.
      Must be location-agnostic (per SH-4 decision).
    objective: "REF-002 published with complete reference schema"
    rationale: "Required for capability flow specifications to reference inputs/outputs"

      Part of Phase 3 (Requirements Definition Phase) self-hosting work.
      Per SH-4 decision: design abstractions that don't assume filesystem storage.

      Define Context Graph schema for TMS-aligned operations:

      - Edge types (relationships between nodes)
      - TMS operations (locate, route, retrieve, refresh, discover, invalidate)

      Per planning-future-work.md: Context Graph is operational TMS.
