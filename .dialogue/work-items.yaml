      - .claude/skills/dialogue-resolve-reference/SKILL.md — Skill definition
      - .claude/skills/dialogue-resolve-reference/scripts/resolve-reference.sh — Filesystem implementation

      Runtime artifact resolution (what deployments have access to):
      - Project docs: THY-NNN, REF-NNN, STR-NNN, ADR-NNN (in implementation/, decisions/)
      - Log entries: DEC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS, OBS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
      - Work items: SH-NNN, CD-NNN, FW-NNN
      - Actors: human:<id>, ai:<id>
      - External URLs: Returns EXTERNAL status (use WebFetch)

      Framework source references (F-N, C-N, I-N, G-N, E-N):
      - NOT resolvable by deployed framework — these are framework source docs
      - Returns NOT_SUPPORTED status directing to framework documentation
      - See FW-005 for deployment artifact definition

      Output formats: full (content), metadata (location only), path (just file path)

      Node Types:
      - ARTIFACT: Documents, decisions, observations, work items, ADRs
      - ACTOR_HUMAN: Human participants with expertise and roles
      - ACTOR_AI: AI actors with capability profiles and reliability metrics

      TMS Operations (Wegner-aligned):
      - locate(query) → Directory lookup

      - retrieve(node_id) → Content retrieval (delegates to SH-002 resolver)

      Define what constitutes a framework deployment vs framework source:

      Problem identified: The resolver script hardcodes 'concepts/' paths, but a
      framework deployment won't include the concepts/ directory—that's framework
      source documentation, not runtime artifacts.

      Need to distinguish:
      1. Framework source artifacts (concepts/, papers/, research/)
         - Framework reference documentation
         - Academic foundations
         - Not deployed with projects using the framework

      2. Framework deployment artifacts (.claude/, .dialogue/)
         - Skills, agents, commands
         - Log schemas and scripts
         - Deployed/copied to projects using the framework

      3. Project runtime artifacts (decisions/, .dialogue/logs/)
         - Project-specific decisions, observations
         - Work items
         - Created by projects using the framework

      Questions to resolve:
      - How do deployed projects access framework documentation?
      - What's the package/distribution model?
      - Should framework docs be web-accessible? Bundled? Linked?
      - How does the resolver know which mode it's operating in?

      Additional issue identified:
      - Resolver hardcodes 'implementation/' paths for THY/REF/STR documents
      - Deployed projects may store these anywhere
      - Need configuration mechanism for artifact locations
      - Possible solution: .dialogue/config.yaml with path mappings
    objective: "Clear deployment model with configurable artifact locations"
    rationale: "Resolver currently hardcodes paths that won't exist in deployments"
