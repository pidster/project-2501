  - "OBS-20260207-104144"  # Collaboration pattern trajectory insight
open_questions:
  - "Should the Dialogue Agent spec encode a collaboration trajectory (AI-Led → Partnership → Human-Led) explicitly, or should the collaboration patterns concept itself evolve to support trajectories?"
  - "What signals mark the transition points between collaboration stages? Candidates: context graph density, user-initiated captures, reduced guidance-seeking, vocabulary adoption."
notes: |
  Implemented plan to activate Dialogue Agent as primary entry point (commit ca986cc):
  - Created SessionStart identity hook (dialogue-agent-identity.sh)
  - Added process delegation routing hook (process-delegation-routing.sh)
  - Added auto-approve hook for Process Orchestrator Task invocations
  - Updated session-start-guided.sh labels to "Dialogue Agent active"
  - Added Agent Identity section to CLAUDE.md
  - Added Process Delegation Protocol to dialogue-agent.md
  - Added Invocation Model to process-orchestrator.md
  - Added agent_architecture: two-agent config key

  Then explored a theoretical question: the Dialogue Agent's collaboration pattern
  shouldn't be fixed at Human-Led. It follows a trajectory from AI-Led (onboarding)
  through Partnership to Human-Led as the user gains competency. This mirrors
  progressive disclosure but extends it from vocabulary to who leads the work.
  The two-agent architecture surfaced this tension — the agent does significant
  autonomous work (graph mapping, delegation) that exceeds Human-Led's definition.

  Open design question: localised change to agent spec vs framework-level evolution
  of the collaboration patterns concept to support trajectories.
