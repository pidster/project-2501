notes: |
  Session focused on two main areas:
  
  1. PR merge conflict resolution (FW-049→FW-051)
     - Discovered task ID collision between branches
     - Renumbered to FW-051, rebased, force pushed
     - PR #1 now ready to merge
  
  2. FW-050: Auto team mode chicken-and-egg fix
     - Problem: users only registered in team mode, but 2+ users needed for team mode
     - Fix: register users if config != solo; promote auto→team permanently at 2+ users
     - Design decision: no team→solo transition (history is permanent)
     - PR #2 created
  
  3. Workflow exploration
     - Discussed fork-based workflow complexity for task IDs
     - Created FW-052 to track collision prevention work
     - Principle: pull before ID generation, detect at PR creation, handle small merge window
  
  Current branch: feature/FW-050
  Fork main has: FW-050, FW-051, FW-052 tasks + observations + decisions
  
  Open PRs:
  - PR #1: FW-051 (EOF fix) - ready to merge
  - PR #2: FW-050 (auto team mode) - ready for review
