active_focus: "Exploring task ID collision prevention in fork-based workflows"
recent_tasks:
  - "FW-051"  # Renumbered from FW-049 due to collision
  - "FW-050"  # Auto team mode bug (tracked)
recent_decisions:
  - "DEC-20260203-182610"  # Task renumbering decision
recent_observations:
  - "OBS-20260203-184103"  # Fork workflow collision risk
open_questions:
  - "Should task files use timestamps like decisions/observations to avoid collisions?"
  - "What's the intended task creation flow across forks - upstream first or reconcile at merge?"
  - "Should .dialogue/tasks/ even be in the repo, or use GitHub Issues instead?"
  - "How to handle multi-branch work with separate PRs from same fork?"
notes: |
  Session started with PR merge conflict on FW-049 - two different tasks had same ID.
  Resolved by renumbering to FW-051, rebasing, force pushing.
  
  This triggered exploration of broader workflow questions:
  - Fork topology means multiple independent .dialogue/tasks/ directories
  - next-id.sh generates IDs locally with no remote awareness
  - Current warning only checks origin/main, not fork relationships
  
  Switched to main branch on fork to explore these questions properly.
  Need to discuss intended mental model for task management across forks.
  
  PR for FW-051 is ready to merge: https://github.com/pidster/project-2501/pull/1
