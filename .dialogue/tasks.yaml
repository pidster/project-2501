      - .claude/skills/dialogue-resolve-reference/scripts/resolve-reference.sh — Filesystem implementation

      Runtime artifact resolution (what deployments have access to):
      - Project docs: THY-NNN, REF-NNN, STR-NNN, ADR-NNN (in implementation/, decisions/)
      - Log entries: DEC-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS, OBS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS
      - Work items: SH-NNN, CD-NNN, FW-NNN
      - Actors: human:<id>, ai:<id>
      - External URLs: Returns EXTERNAL status (use WebFetch)

      Framework source references (F-N, C-N, I-N, G-N, E-N):
      - NOT resolvable by deployed framework — these are framework source docs
      - Returns NOT_SUPPORTED status directing to framework documentation
      - See FW-005 for deployment artifact definition

      Output formats: full (content), metadata (location only), path (just file path)

         - Reference patterns F-N, C-N, I-N, G-N, E-N return NOT_SUPPORTED
         - Access via web docs or framework repository clone

      2. Deployment Artifacts (distributed): .claude/, .dialogue/, decisions/
         - Skills, agents, commands, logging infrastructure
         - Copied/installed to projects using framework

      3. Project Artifacts (created at runtime): decisions/ADR-*, .dialogue/logs/

      Operationalise Phase 1 guidance in framework-manual.md and AI configuration.

      REVISED APPROACH: Examples are not useful outputs. Either they're drafts awaiting
      promotion, or experiments to be analysed and discarded. Real outputs should be:
      1. Updates to framework-manual.md (operational reference practitioners use)
      2. Updates to AI configuration (skills, agents, rules that guide behaviour)

      Tasks:
      1. Extract insights from draft example_phase1-document-type-registry.md
      2. Update framework-manual.md with Phase 1 operational guidance:
         - Document types (what to capture, not ceremony)
         - Straw man pattern (placeholders are valid)
         - Scaling guidance (minimal vs full Phase 1)
         - Collaboration patterns (Human-Only, Human-Led)
         - Functional roles (Facilitator, Scribe high-value per I-3)
      3. Create/update skills or agents for Phase 1 behaviour
      4. Archive or delete example file once insights absorbed

      Key insights to preserve:
      - 75% tacit composition means AI assists but cannot lead
      - Straw man documents make assumptions explicit and trackable
      - Process references trace lineage, not mandate ceremony
      - Capture windows critical for ephemeral documents
    objective: "Phase 1 guidance operationalised in framework-manual.md and AI config"
    rationale: |
      Examples without consumers are dead documents. The real outputs are:
      - framework-manual.md updates (where practitioners look)
      - AI configuration (what actually implements behaviour)
      Insight from user: "either it is a draft awaiting review, or it is an experiment
      to be analyzed and accepted/discarded."

      Created 14 January 2026 from Phase 1-2 analysis.
      REVISED 14 January 2026: Changed from "create exemplar" to "operationalise guidance".

      Completed 14 January 2026:
      - Analysed capability registry for actor implementation approach
      - Extracted operational guidance from draft example_phase1-document-type-registry.md
      - Updated framework-manual.md v1.2 with Phase 1 operational guidance:
        * Information composition and implications
        * Collaboration pattern constraints
        * Functional roles (Facilitator, Scribe high-value)
        * Scaling guidance (minimal vs full)
        * Straw man pattern documentation
        * Capture window criticality
        * Rationale-first validation checklist
        * AI configuration guidance

      Operationalise Phase 1 capability flows in framework-manual.md and AI configuration.

      REVISED APPROACH: Same principle as SH-008. Outputs should be operational,
      not example documents.

      Tasks:
      1. Define Phase 1 processes in framework-manual.md:
         - PROC-1.1: Opportunity Identification
         - PROC-1.2: Stakeholder Alignment
         - PROC-1.3: Problem Framing
         - PROC-1.4: Business Case Development
      2. For each process, specify in framework-manual.md:
         - Capability instances (mostly Elicit, Synthesise, Decide)
         - Functional roles (Facilitator, Scribe per I-3 FW-007)
         - Actor patterns (Human-Only, Human-Led)
         - Escalation triggers
         - Completion criteria
      3. Create/update AI configuration:
         - Skills for Phase 1 elicitation (dialogue-structured-elicit already exists)
         - Agent behaviour rules for tacit-heavy phases
         - Hooks or prompts that activate Facilitator/Scribe roles

      Key insight: Phase 1 is heavily Elicit/Synthesise/Decide, not Transform/Generate/Preserve.
    objective: "Phase 1 capability flows operationalised in framework-manual.md and AI config"
    rationale: |
      Companion to SH-008. Capability flows operationalise how work happens;
      the output should be guidance practitioners use and AI configuration that
      implements the behaviour, not an example document.

      Tasks:
      1. Update framework-manual.md with Phase 2 operational guidance:
         - Document types (project plan, risk register, resource allocation, governance)
         - Information composition (55% tacit, 10% emergent, 35% formal)
         - Planning spans most of project lifecycle and refines iteratively
         - Collaboration patterns shift as planning becomes more formal
      2. Create/update AI configuration for Phase 2 behaviour

      Note: Planning is unique—it bridges Initiation's tacit-heavy work to
      Analysis's balanced work, and spans most of project lifecycle.
    objective: "Phase 2 guidance operationalised in framework-manual.md and AI config"

      C-7 (Phase-Aware Measurement) states early phases require qualitative assessment
      of "stakeholder alignment", "shared understanding", "problem framing adequacy"
      but provides no operationalisation.

      Tasks:
      1. Review Ryan & O'Connor's Team Tacit Knowledge Measure for Phase 1-2 applicability
      2. Identify or develop indicators for stakeholder alignment
      3. Create checklist for problem framing adequacy assessment
      4. Link measurement approaches to existing evidence base (Meyer good days, Obi bad days)
      5. Update C-7 with operationalised guidance or acknowledge gap explicitly

      Later phases have DORA, SPACE, DevEx. Early phases need equivalent.
    objective: "C-7 updated with operationalised Phase 1-2 measurement or explicit gap acknowledgement"

      Address transition mitigation gap for early phases.

      C-6 (Transitions & Information Loss) quantifies 35-45% loss at Initiation→Planning,
      40-50% at Planning→Analysis, but doesn't provide phase-specific mitigation strategies.

      Later phases have ADRs (Design→Implementation) mentioned. Early phases need equivalent.

      Tasks:
      1. Identify what specific tacit knowledge is lost at Initiation→Planning
      2. Research or develop mitigation practices for early-phase transitions
      3. Consider: stakeholder continuity, rationale capture, decision logging, context preservation
      4. Update C-6 with phase-specific mitigation guidance
      5. Cross-reference with dialogue skills (log-decision, log-observation) as mitigation tools

      Framework's own concepts predict early-phase mitigation has highest value
      because tacit loss is greatest there.
    objective: "C-6 updated with Phase 1-2 transition mitigation strategies"
    rationale: |
      Highest-value mitigation opportunities are in early phases where tacit loss
      is greatest, yet guidance focuses on later phases. This is backwards per

      Questions to explore:

      2. Is the 10% constant across phases empirically grounded or placeholder?
      3. Is "emergent" distinct enough from "tacit" to warrant separate tracking?

      Extend I-3 (Naur-Wegner Integration) with functional actor roles section.

      Gap identified: C-4 defines actor *types* (Human vs AI) and C-5 defines
      collaboration *patterns*, but neither defines functional *roles* that
      operationalise how actors perform TMS operations through dialogue.

      Functional roles to define:
      - Facilitator: Structures dialogue, prompts articulation (directory updates, encoding)
      - Synthesiser: Integrates information, proposes understanding (encoding, coordination)
      - Validator: Tests understanding, confirms accuracy (retrieval, credibility)
      - Scribe: Captures and preserves outputs (externalisation, PRESERVE)
      - Researcher: Retrieves external information (retrieval from external sources)

      Key insight: Roles are independent of actor type. Both humans and AI can fill
      them with different strengths. AI doesn't need to hold tacit knowledge to help
      humans externalise it (Facilitator role).

      Extension should add to I-3:
      - Functional role definitions (distinct from organisational roles per C-4)
      - Role-TMS operation mapping
      - Actor-role suitability guidance
      - Phase-role relevance

      Address unmodelled AI capability evolution in THY-003 and F-2.

      Current position: Human-AI TMS asymmetry exists because "AI context is ephemeral"

      Unaddressed: What happens as context windows expand (4K → 200K+ and growing)?
      Does this change the asymmetry analysis? When does it become qualitatively different?

      Tasks:
      1. Model how asymmetry changes with context window size
      2. Identify thresholds where qualitative shifts might occur
      3. Maintain temporal qualification (as of 2024-2025) while acknowledging trajectory

      Research an SDLC project orchestrator for human-user-interface interaction
      and activity orchestration.

      **Scope (narrowed per DEC-20260115-083726)**:
      - How should human input be routed to appropriate framework activities?
      - How should the orchestrator delegate to specialised agents?
      - This is about the user-interface layer, NOT about how actors work within phases

      **Explicitly out of scope**:
      - Replacing the "actors emerge from configuration" model (SH-008)
      - Defining how actors operate within phases
      - Making architectural commitments at this stage

      **Open questions for research**:
      1. What is the orchestrator's responsibility boundary?
         - Route human input to appropriate phase/activity?
         - Maintain awareness of project state and context?

      2. How do specialised agents relate to the orchestrator?
         - Task tool spawning?
         - What context do they need?

      3. How does this layer interact with the emergent actor model?
         - Orchestrator routes; actors within phases still emerge from configuration?
         - Two-layer model: orchestration layer + execution layer?

      **Key constraint**: No final assertions. This is exploratory research.

    objective: "Research orchestrator pattern for human-AI interaction layer"
    rationale: |
      The framework needs a way to handle human input and route it appropriately.
      This is distinct from how actors operate within phases (which may still
      emerge from configuration per SH-008 insight).

      === Sub-task Completed: FW-009 (Hooks Investigation) ===
      Key findings (DEC-20260115-084309):
      - Hooks are guards/lifecycle handlers, NOT orchestration primitives
      - All matching hooks run in PARALLEL (no sequential workflow)
      - Recommended pattern: Hooks for validation/enforcement, Subagents for delegation,
        Skills/commands for workflow, Claude's reasoning for routing

      === Thought Experiment: Plugin Delivery Model (15 January 2026) ===
      Explored Claude Code Plugin as framework delivery mechanism.

      Hook events mapped to framework purposes:
      - SessionStart: Restore TMS context (retrieval operation)
      - SessionEnd: Create session memo (externalisation operation)
      - PreToolUse: Phase constraint validation?
      - PostToolUse: Auto-capture significant actions as observations?
      - Stop: Intelligent continuation decisions
      - UserPromptSubmit: Context injection based on detected intent

      Session Continuity Pattern (SessionStart + SessionEnd):
      - SessionEnd creates structured memo: active work items, recent decisions/observations,
        phase context, open questions
      - SessionStart reads memo, presents project state (phase-independent per C-3 v2.0)
      - Addresses ephemeral context problem through TMS externalisation/retrieval

      Key insight (OBS-20260115-091213, DEC-20260115-092904):
      - Phases have implied linearity but retrograde steps are valid process outcomes
      - SessionStart must be phase-independent (C-3 v2.0 retrograde navigation)
      - Framework should help NAVIGATE retrograde steps, not just trace them

      Decomposition insight:
      - Orchestration (routing human input) → Claude's reasoning + CLAUDE.md + skills
      - Session continuity (TMS persistence) → Hook-based automation (SessionStart/SessionEnd)
      - Guardrails (phase constraints) → Hook-based validation (PreToolUse, Stop)
      - Capture (preserving what happens) → Hook-based or manual (PostToolUse, skills)

      The "orchestrator agent" may be less necessary if hooks handle continuity
      and Claude's reasoning handles routing based on good context injection.

      Open questions remaining:
      1. Session memo format and location (.dialogue/session-memo.yaml?)
      2. Prompt-based vs shell hooks for each purpose
      3. How to present phase-independent project state effectively
      4. Integration with work item state

      Investigate Claude Code hooks: how they work, what functionality is available,

      Questions to answer:
      1. What hook events are available? (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, SessionStart, etc.)
      2. What can hooks do? (block, modify, inject context, trigger actions?)
      3. How are hooks implemented? (shell scripts, prompt-based, other?)
      4. What information is available to hooks? (tool name, parameters, context?)
      5. Can hooks communicate with each other or maintain state?
      6. What are the limitations and constraints?

      Relevance to FW-008:
      - Could hooks provide orchestration without explicit orchestrator agent?
      - SessionStart hook for context injection?
      - PreToolUse for routing decisions?
      - PostToolUse for logging/capture?

         - No inter-hook communication
         - No state machine or workflow management
         - Stateless by default (state requires disk persistence)

         - Shell scripts: Fast, simple validation
         - Prompt-based (Haiku LLM): Smarter context-aware decisions

      4. Most promising for orchestration:
         - Stop hook (prompt-based): Can intelligently decide phase completion
         - UserPromptSubmit: Can inject context, validate prompts
         - SessionStart: Context injection, environment setup

      5. Recommended pattern (from docs):
         "Hooks for validation/enforcement, Subagents for task delegation,
         Skills/commands for workflow definition"

      Assessment: Hooks alone cannot provide orchestration. Layered approach needed:
      - Hooks for guardrails and capture
      - Prompt-based Stop hook for intelligent continuation decisions
      - Subagents (Task tool) for phase-specific work
      - Claude's reasoning for actual routing decisions

      Improve registry_claude-code.yaml with:

      1. Environment variables reference:
         - Document available environment variables (CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, etc.)
         - Note which variables are available in which contexts (hooks, skills, scripts)
         - Skill scripts should use these instead of hardcoded paths

      2. Path-filtering configuration clarity:
         - Improve description of how rules path-matching works
         - Clarify relationship between globs patterns and rule activation
         - Document when to use rules vs skills vs manual guidance

      Gap identified: Skill scripts currently don't use available environment variables,
      and registry doesn't document them clearly.
    objective: "Registry documents environment variables and clarifies path-filtering config"
    rationale: |
      Environment variables enable portable, context-aware scripts.
      Current scripts hardcode paths that may not work in all contexts.
      OBS-20260115-085039 records the gap.
