# AI-Augmented SDLC Framework

## Project Overview

This project develops a comprehensive AI-Augmented Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Framework grounded in empirical research and theoretical foundations. The framework bridges theoretical software engineering concepts with practical implementation guidance, targeting publication in top-tier academic venues such as IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering.

**Core thesis**: Software development is fundamentally about building shared mental models ("theories") in developers' minds, with 70-80% of software knowledge being tacit rather than documented. This has profound implications for AI integration, as different SDLC phases have vastly different information compositions requiring different human-AI collaboration patterns.

## Key Theoretical Foundations

### Socio-Technical Systems Theory (1951-2011)

STS theory provides the system-level design lens. Core principle: **joint optimisation**—social and technical subsystems must be co-designed, not optimised independently.

**Key sources:**
- Trist & Bamforth (1951): Founded STS through coal mining research
- Cherns (1976): Nine actionable design principles
- Baxter & Sommerville (2011): Bridge to software engineering

**Implication**: Human-AI work systems require deliberate socio-technical design, not just AI tool adoption.

### Naur's Theory-Building (1985)

Software development involves building a "theory" in developers' minds—understanding of problem space, solution rationale, and modification implications. This theory cannot be fully documented; losing theory-holding developers causes "program death."

**Implication**: AI cannot replace human theory-building but can support it.

### Wegner's Transactive Memory (1986)

Teams develop shared knowledge systems where members know *who knows what* rather than everyone knowing everything. This distributed cognition enables collective capability exceeding individual capacity.

**Implication**: AI tools must integrate with team knowledge structures, not replace them.

### Naur-Wegner Integration

Individual theory-building (Naur) and team transactive memory (Wegner) are complementary:
- **Theory death**: Loss of individuals holding deep understanding
- **Transactive memory degradation**: Disruption of "who knows what" coordination

Teams can fail through either mechanism—requiring different remediation strategies.

### Phase Information Composition

Different phases have different formal/tacit/emergent ratios:

| Phase | Formal | Tacit | Emergent |
|-------|--------|-------|----------|
| 1. Initiation | 5% | 75% | 20% |
| 2. Planning | 35% | 55% | 10% |
| 3. Requirements | 40% | 50% | 10% |
| 4. Design | 50% | 40% | 10% |
| 5. Implementation | 55% | 35% | 10% |
| 6. Testing | 60% | 30% | 10% |
| 7. Operations | 60% | 30% | 10% |

**These are derived estimates**, not empirically measured values. Present as "approximate compositions" for guidance, not precise measurements.

### Three-Layer Guidance Architecture

The framework occupies Layer 2 in a three-layer model:

1. **Layer 1: Process Abstractions** (decadal stability) — ISO/IEC/IEEE standards
2. **Layer 2: Application Framework** (annual updates) — This framework
3. **Layer 3: Implementation Patterns** (continuous change) — Tool-specific practices

## Evidential Standards

### Evidence Tiers

| Tier | Type | Causal Inference |
|------|------|------------------|
| T1 | Experimental/Quasi-experimental | Can support causation |
| T2 | Longitudinal/Panel | Establishes temporal precedence only |
| T3 | Cross-sectional with controls | Correlation only |
| T4 | Descriptive/Case study | Association only |

### Strong Evidence (cite confidently)

- **STS Mirroring Hypothesis**: 69% support across 142 studies (Colfer & Baldwin 2016)
- **Socio-Technical Congruence**: 32% reduction in resolution time (Cataldo et al. 2008)
- **DORA metrics**: N=39,000+ professionals, validated for Phases 5-7
- **Developer Thriving**: r=0.43 with productivity (Hicks et al., N=1,282)
- **Good Day factors**: 60.6% good days validated (Meyer et al., N=5,971)
- **TTKM**: r=0.35 with team effectiveness (Ryan & O'Connor, N=48 teams)

### Weak Evidence (do not cite as primary)

- **CHAOS/Standish statistics**: Methodologically contested; "Standish opinion"
- **39-47% requirements failure**: No systematic review, wildly varying figures
- **Boehm's 50-200x cost curve**: 1970s waterfall data, not validated in modern contexts

### Evidential Language

Use language that signals evidential weight:

```markdown
✓ "Research indicates..." (for peer-reviewed findings)
✓ "Synthesis of evidence suggests..." (for derived conclusions)
✓ "Estimated at approximately..." (for reasoned approximations)
✓ "For illustrative purposes..." (for worked examples)

✗ Avoid presenting derived figures as directly measured
✗ Avoid absolute statements about AI capabilities without temporal qualification
```

## Writing Standards

### British English

Use British spelling throughout: organise, colour, behaviour, analyse, centre, etc.

### Temporal Qualification

Always qualify AI capability claims:

```markdown
✗ "AI cannot build theory"
✓ "Current AI systems (as of 2024-2025) do not build theory in Naur's sense—they generate artefacts without developing the explanatory understanding that enables maintenance and extension"
```

### Prescriptive vs Descriptive Voice

Maintain separation between:
- **Descriptive**: "This phase exhibits..."
- **Analytical**: "Research indicates..."
- **Prescriptive**: "Organisations should..."

Signal transitions between modes. Consider separate "Recommendations" sections.

### Quantitative Claims

When making quantitative claims:
1. **Directly measured** — cite specific study, sample size, methodology
2. **Derived from synthesis** — explain reasoning chain and source inputs
3. **Estimated or illustrative** — state explicitly as approximations

### Standards Alignment

When referencing ISO/IEC/IEEE standards:
- Distinguish "defined by" (standard specifies) from "synthesised from" (framework derives)
- Note specific standard version and year
- Acknowledge where framework extends beyond standard

Example:
> "This seven-phase model synthesises ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 process definitions into lifecycle stages; the phase boundaries and actor patterns are framework constructs, not ISO-defined elements."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Overgeneralising actor suitability** — Determine at capability *instance* level, not broad capability categories
2. **Treating phase percentages as measured** — They are derived estimates for guidance
3. **Citing CHAOS/Standish as evidence** — Methodologically problematic
4. **Making absolute AI capability claims** — Always temporally qualify
5. **Optimising early phases for speed** — Understanding-heavy phases shouldn't prioritise velocity
6. **Conflating correlation with causation** — Most evidence is correlational (Tier 3)
7. **Using American spellings** — British English throughout
8. **Ignoring joint optimisation** — Human-AI systems require socio-technical design, not just AI adoption
9. **Companion naming mismatch** — Companion files must match PDF names exactly

## Key Statistics to Know

| Metric | Value | Source | Evidence Tier |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| STS mirroring support | 69% of 142 studies | Colfer & Baldwin 2016 | Meta-analysis |

## Editing Workflow

When making changes:

1. **Check cross-references** — Update all documents that reference changed content
2. **Verify percentage sums** — Ensure formal+tacit+emergent = 100%
3. **Maintain terminology consistency** — Use glossary terms exactly
4. **Preserve evidence citations** — Don't remove sample sizes or study references
5. **Test Mermaid diagrams** — Ensure syntax is valid
6. **Verify link paths** — All internal links should use correct relative paths
7. **Check companion alignment** — PDF and companion names must match

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Find all references to a term
grep -r "term" concepts/ papers/ research/

# Check for American spellings
grep -rE "(organize|color|behavior)" concepts/ papers/

# Verify markdown link integrity
grep -oE '\[.*\]\(.*\.md\)' concepts/*.md | sort | uniq

# List PDFs without companions
ls papers/*.pdf | sed 's/.pdf/-companion.md/' | xargs -I {} sh -c 'test -f papers/{} || echo "Missing: {}"'
```

## Contact/Context

This framework is being developed for academic publication targeting IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering. The work synthesises existing research rather than presenting new empirical findings, building a conceptual framework that addresses why software projects fail despite AI advancement.

Primary theoretical tension: How do we integrate AI capabilities into software development while preserving the tacit knowledge and theory-building that determine project success?

**Core insight from STS**: The question is not "how do we use AI to improve productivity?" but rather "how do we *design the work system* so that human cognitive strengths and AI capabilities are jointly optimised?"
