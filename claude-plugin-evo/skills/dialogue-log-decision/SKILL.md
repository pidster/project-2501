# Dialogue: Decision Logger

Log a decision to the decision log. The decision log is a chronological audit trail of all decisions, from routine operational choices to architectural decisions.

## Decision Type Hierarchy

| Type | When to Use | Required Fields | Framework Grounding |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **OPERATIONAL** | Routine choices during task execution | outcome, rationale | WRK domain, Ephemeral, documentable knowledge |
| **TACTICAL** | Approach changes affecting method | outcome, rationale | WRK domain, Ephemeral-Dynamic, elicitable knowledge |
| **DESIGN** | Component/schema decisions with rationale | outcome, rationale, **context** | STR domain, Dynamic-Standing, elicitable with rationale |
| **ADR** | Cross-reference to Architecture Decision Record | outcome, rationale, **context**, ref | STR domain, Standing, formal alternatives analysis |

### Choosing the Right Type

```
Did you formally evaluate multiple alternatives with trade-offs?
  YES → Use ADR type (create ADR document first, then log with ref)
  NO  → Continue...

Does this affect how a component or schema works?
  YES → Use DESIGN
  NO  → Continue...

Does this change your approach to the current task?
  YES → Use TACTICAL
  NO  → Use OPERATIONAL
```

## How to Log a Decision

Execute the following bash command:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dialogue-log-decision/scripts/log-decision.sh <type> <actor> <subject> <outcome> <rationale> [context] [tags] [ref]
```

### Required Parameters

| Parameter | Values | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `type` | `OPERATIONAL`, `TACTICAL`, `DESIGN`, or `ADR` | Decision significance level |
| `actor` | `ai:claude` or `human:<id>` | Who made the decision |
| `subject` | text | Brief description of what the decision concerns |
| `outcome` | text | What was decided or done |
| `rationale` | text | Single-line reasoning (why this choice) |

### Conditionally Required Parameters

| Parameter | Required For | Description |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| `context` | DESIGN, ADR | Additional surrounding situation—what led to this decision |

### Optional Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `context` | Additional context (optional for OPERATIONAL/TACTICAL) |
| `tags` | Comma-separated categorisation tags |
| `ref` | Reference to related document (e.g., `ADR-001` for ADR type) |

## Examples

### OPERATIONAL Decision
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dialogue-log-decision/scripts/log-decision.sh OPERATIONAL "ai:claude" "Test failure response" "Added null check to validateInput()" "TypeError indicated undefined parameter" "" "fix,validation"
```

### TACTICAL Decision
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dialogue-log-decision/scripts/log-decision.sh TACTICAL "human:pidster" "Refactoring approach" "Refactor auth module before adding feature" "Reduce complexity before extending" "" "refactor,auth"
```

### DESIGN Decision
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dialogue-log-decision/scripts/log-decision.sh DESIGN "human:pidster" "Information reference schema approach" "Simplified from URI format to self-describing IDs" "Simpler format reduces cognitive load, maintains backward compatibility" "Initial v1 had complex URI format; user directed simplification" "schema,simplification"
```

### ADR Cross-Reference
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dialogue-log-decision/scripts/log-decision.sh ADR "human:pidster" "Graph storage approach" "Created ADR-001 for filesystem-first strategy" "Architectural decision requiring formal alternatives analysis" "Evaluated Kuzu, Neo4j, filesystem options" "architecture,storage" "ADR-001"
```

## Output

The script returns the generated decision ID (e.g., `DEC-20260113-143215`).

## When to Use ADR vs DESIGN

**Use DESIGN when:**
- You chose an approach but didn't formally document alternatives
- The decision affects a component but not the whole system
- Rationale matters but a full ADR would be overkill

**Use ADR when:**
- You formally evaluated 2+ alternatives with pros/cons
- The decision has system-wide architectural impact
- You need to document consequences and trade-offs
- Future developers will need to understand why

**Process for ADR:**
1. Create ADR document using `dialogue-create-adr` skill
2. Log cross-reference using this skill with type=ADR and ref=ADR-NNN

## Granularity Guidelines

### One Decision Per Distinct Choice

Log **one decision entry per distinct choice**. Do not batch multiple decisions into a single entry.

### Why Granularity Matters

- **Audit trail**: Each decision can be reviewed independently
- **Traceability**: Specific rationale for each choice is preserved
- **Search**: Can find all decisions about a specific subject
- **Compliance verification**: Can count decisions against expected count

### When Batching Is Acceptable

Batch only when:
- The decisions are truly identical (same rationale applies to all)
- The items being decided have no individual identity
- Example: "Applied consistent formatting to all 15 files" (one formatting decision, multiple files)
