## Summary

This concepts directory forms the core intellectual foundation of the AI-Augmented SDLC Framework. The framework addresses a fundamental challenge: how to systematically integrate AI capabilities into software development while preserving the human cognitive engagement essential for building and maintaining **theory** about software systems.

### Key Principles

1. **Theory Building over Artifact Production**: Following Naur (1985), the framework recognises that the primary product of software development is the coherent understanding in developers' minds, not the code or documentation they produce. This theory cannot be fully articulated and is essential for intelligent system evolution.

2. **Phase-Aware Collaboration**: Different SDLC phases have different information compositions (formal/tacit/emergent ratios) that determine appropriate human-AI collaboration patterns. Early phases are tacit-heavy and require human leadership; later phases are formal-heavy and enable greater AI autonomy.

3. **Rigour over Influence**: The framework prioritises empirically validated research over industry folklore. Selection criteria emphasise theoretical coherence, empirical grounding, and methodological transparency rather than popularity.

4. **Information Preservation**: Phase transitions are critical points where information—particularly tacit knowledge—can be lost. The framework provides explicit strategies for preserving understanding across handoffs.

5. **Capability-Based Reasoning**: Eight fundamental capabilities (Elicit, Synthesise, Decide, Generate, Transform, Validate, Preserve, Coordinate) provide granular analysis of what work requires human engagement versus what can be delegated to AI.

### Framework Architecture

The documents follow a layered structure:

- **Foundations** establish the theoretical and standards basis
- **Concepts** define the core abstractions and models
- **Integrations** show how components connect into a coherent whole
- **Guidance** provides practical application advice
- **Examples** demonstrate concrete application

This architecture enables the framework to remain stable at higher abstraction levels while adapting to evolving AI capabilities at implementation levels.
