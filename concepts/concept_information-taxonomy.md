# Key Reference Concept 1: Information Composition Taxonomy

## Definition

Software development involves three fundamentally different types of information, each requiring different handling approaches. **Formal** information is explicitly representable and machine-processable. **Tacit** information is experientially embedded and resists complete articulation. **Emergent** information arises from interactions and doesn't exist until exploration creates it. Any software artifact or activity involves some composition of all three types, and this composition determines appropriate documentation strategies, automation levels, and collaboration patterns.

## The Three Information Types

| Type | Definition | Examples | AI Accessibility |
|------|------------|----------|------------------|
| **Formal** | Explicitly representable, machine-processable, verifiable | Source code, specifications, schemas, test cases, API contracts | **High** - AI can process, generate, and validate |
| **Tacit** | Experientially embedded, resists articulation, "we know more than we can tell" | Architectural intuition, coding judgement, stakeholder context, design rationale | **Low** - AI cannot access or replicate human experiential knowledge |
| **Emergent** | Arises from interactions, discoverable unknown, doesn't exist until exploration | Creative insights, unexpected requirements, system behaviors, team dynamics | **Very Low** - AI cannot observe emergence in real-time contexts |

## Measuring Information Composition

Activities and artifacts can be characterised by their approximate information composition. These are estimates, not precise measurements:

**Indicators of high formal content:**
- Produces machine-verifiable artifacts
- Can be completely specified in advance
- Success criteria are unambiguous
- Same inputs consistently produce same outputs

**Indicators of high tacit content:**
- Requires extensive experience to perform well
- Experts struggle to fully explain their process
- Judgement and intuition are central
- Novices produce qualitatively different results

**Indicators of high emergent content:**
- Outcomes cannot be fully predicted in advance
- Understanding develops through exploration
- Participants discover new information through interaction
- Requirements or designs change as work proceeds

**Typical phase compositions (directional patterns):**
- **Early phases** (Initiation, Planning): 60-75% tacit, 10-25% formal, 10-20% emergent
- **Middle phases** (Requirements, Design): 40-50% tacit, 40-50% formal, 10% emergent
- **Later phases** (Implementation, Testing, Operations): 30-40% tacit, 55-65% formal, 5-10% emergent

## Key Implications

**For documentation strategy:** Formal information can and should be comprehensively documented. Tacit information requires supplementary approaches (mentoring, pair programming, communities of practice). Emergent information cannot be documented in advance but can be captured retrospectively.

**For human-AI collaboration:** AI operates effectively on formal information but cannot directly access tacit or emergent knowledge. The information composition of an activity influences appropriate automation levels—formal-heavy activities enable AI-Led patterns, while tacit-heavy activities typically require Human-Only or Human-Led patterns. However, well-designed escalation mechanisms (see Concept 7) enable AI participation in mixed-composition activities by ensuring human engagement when tacit judgement is required.

**For measurement:** Formal-heavy activities support quantitative metrics. Tacit-heavy activities require qualitative assessment. Mixed-composition activities need hybrid measurement approaches.

**For team organisation:** Activities with high tacit composition benefit from team stability (preserving accumulated understanding). Activities with high formal composition support more flexible staffing.

**For theory building:** Tacit knowledge is what makes theory "theory"—the understanding that resides in developers' minds and enables intelligent system evolution. Over-automating tacit-heavy activities risks theory atrophy.

## Document Lifecycle Classification

Documents can be further classified by their temporal characteristics and organisational scope, based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2019. This classification intersects with information composition to guide retention policies, automation levels, and knowledge management strategies.

### Temporal Classification

| Class | Update Frequency | Lifespan | Information Composition | Typical Automation | Examples |
|-------|------------------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Standing** | Quarterly or less | Years | ~80% tacit capture attempt; 30-40% retention | L2-L3 (humans provide theory, AI assists structure) | Architecture Descriptions, Policies, ADRs, System Specifications |
| **Dynamic** | Weekly or more | Project duration | ~60% formal, 40% tacit interpretation | L3-L4 (AI generates, humans interpret) | Project Plans, Risk Registers, Status Reports, Dashboards |
| **Ephemeral** | Single use | Days to weeks | Point-in-time capture; window at creation or lost | L3-L4 (AI captures, humans add meaning) | Pull Requests, Support Tickets, Meeting Notes, Chat threads |

### Scope Classification

| Scope | Applicability | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Organisational** | Enterprise-wide; conditions decisions across projects | Reference architectures, coding standards, security policies |
| **Project** | Single initiative; tracks project-specific understanding | Solution designs, project plans, requirements specifications |
| **Task** | Single work item; enables immediate coordination | User stories, bug reports, change requests, working notes |

### The Temporal-Scope Matrix

Temporal and scope classifications are orthogonal. A document type occupies a cell in this matrix:

|  | Standing | Dynamic | Ephemeral |
|--|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Organisational** | Enterprise architecture, Policies | Org-wide dashboards, Portfolio status | Leadership announcements |
| **Project** | Solution architecture, ADRs | Sprint plans, Risk registers | Daily standups, PR reviews |
| **Task** | (rare) | Task tracking, Kanban cards | Slack threads, Working notes |

### Knowledge Retention Implications

**Standing documents** attempt to crystallise tacit knowledge into formal artefacts. Research indicates that without supplementary strategies, only 30-40% of original understanding survives formalisation—a significant loss that explains why comprehensive documentation alone fails to preserve organisational knowledge. Standing documents remain essential for preserving retrievable rationale, but must be combined with tacit knowledge transfer mechanisms (mentoring, communities of practice, team continuity) to reduce losses.

**Dynamic documents** track evolving state; their formal content is current but interpretation requires understanding the trajectory. AI can generate and update these effectively; humans provide contextual interpretation.

**Ephemeral documents** capture knowledge at a single moment. If tacit understanding isn't added at creation (e.g., context in a commit message, rationale in a ticket), it's permanently lost. The capture window is narrow and non-recoverable.

### Automation Level Guidance

The temporal classification provides default automation levels that align with collaboration patterns:

- **Standing (L2-L3)**: Human-Led to Partnership. Humans provide the theory and rationale; AI assists with structure, consistency, and completeness checks.
- **Dynamic (L3-L4)**: Partnership to AI-Led. AI generates updates from formal data sources; humans interpret trends and make judgements.
- **Ephemeral (L3-L4)**: Partnership to AI-Led. AI captures and structures point-in-time information; humans add meaning and context.

These levels are defaults; specific documents may require adjustment based on their information composition and organisational context.

## Integration with Other Concepts

- [**Theory-Building Principle**](./foundation_theory-building.md): Theory is tacit by nature—what makes certain knowledge tacit is that it represents theory in developers' minds
- [**Eight-Capability Model**](./concept_capability-model.md): Different capabilities require different knowledge types (Elicit/Synthesise require tacit; Transform/Preserve enable formal)
- [**Seven-Phase SDLC**](04_7phase_SDLC.md): Each phase has characteristic information composition that shifts from tacit-heavy early to formal-heavy late
- [**Actor Model**](./concept_actor-model.md): Human and AI actors differ in their knowledge access—humans can directly access all three types, AI only formal. Escalation mechanisms enable AI participation in activities involving tacit knowledge by ensuring human engagement at critical decision points.
- [**Five Collaboration Patterns**](07_collaboration_patterns.md): Pattern selection depends on activity information composition
- [**Phase-Specific Composition**](06_phase_specific_composition.md): Provides specific percentage estimates for each phase
- [**Information Loss at Transitions**](./concept_transitions-info-loss.md): Tacit and emergent information are disproportionately lost at phase boundaries
- [**Information Loss at Transitions**](./concept_transitions-info-loss.md): Tacit and emergent information are disproportionately lost at phase boundaries. Document lifecycle class affects retention—standing documents preserve rationale but with 30-40% loss; ephemeral documents lose unrecorded tacit knowledge entirely.
- [**Phase-Aware Measurement**](09_phase_aware_measurement.md): Different phases need different measurement approaches based on their information composition

## Evidence Base

**Formal/tacit distinction**: Well-established through Polanyi (1966) and extensive organisational knowledge management literature. **Emergent category**: Conceptually defensible but requires empirical validation. **Specific percentages**: Reasoned estimates requiring systematic measurement studies. **70-80% tacit prevalence**: Multiple studies across software engineering contexts. **42% unique knowledge**: Large-scale survey finding that nearly half of job-critical knowledge exists in individual minds only.

## Validation Status

- ✓ **Formal/tacit distinction**: Empirically validated across multiple domains
- ✓ **Three-type taxonomy**: Conceptually coherent, face validity from practitioners
- ⚠ **Emergent as distinct category**: Requires validation that it's not simply tacit knowledge
- ⚠ **Specific percentages**: Estimates requiring empirical studies with systematic measurement
- ⚠ **Phase progression pattern**: Directionally supported but needs quantitative validation

*This taxonomy provides the foundational framework for reasoning about all other concepts. Understanding what types of information exist and how they're distributed enables principled decisions about documentation, automation, collaboration, and measurement throughout the SDLC.*
