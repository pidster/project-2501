## Purpose

Documents in this directory serve several purposes:

1. **Integration Analyses**: Documents that synthesise multiple sources to develop novel insights
2. **Exploratory Research**: Working analyses that may inform framework development
3. **Archived Originals**: Earlier versions of documents that have been migrated elsewhere but retained for reference

## Relationship to Other Directories
