# Papers

This directory contains academic papers and companion analyses that form the empirical and theoretical evidence base for the AI-Augmented SDLC Framework. The collection spans 1985 to 2025, deliberately selecting sources for their empirical rigour and theoretical coherence rather than industry influence.

## Summary

This papers collection represents a curated evidence base selected according to explicit criteria prioritising empirical validity over industry influence. The selection acknowledges that **influence and validity are orthogonal concerns**—concepts can be widely adopted yet empirically unsupported, or rigorously validated yet underutilised in practice.

### Selection Criteria

Each source meets multiple criteria:

**Essential Criteria:**
- Theoretical coherence with clear conceptual frameworks
- Empirical grounding through data or validated evidence synthesis
- Methodological transparency enabling replication
- Generalisability potential beyond narrow contexts
- Distinct conceptual contribution

**Quality Indicators:**
- Peer review or equivalent validation (9/13 core sources are peer-reviewed)
- Large sample sizes where applicable (N>2,000 in multiple studies)
- Triangulation across methods
- Longitudinal or cross-sectional depth

### Temporal Coverage

The collection deliberately spans seven decades (thirteen core sources per `integration_framework-architecture.md`):

| Era | Sources | Contribution |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| **1951** | Trist & Bamforth (1951) | Founding of socio-technical systems theory; joint optimisation principle |
| **1976** | Cherns (1976) | Nine actionable STS design principles |
| **1985-1990** | Naur (1985), Wegner (1986) | Foundational theory on individual cognition and team memory |
| **2011** | Baxter & Sommerville (2011) | STS bridge to software systems engineering |
| **2013-2019** | Ryan & O'Connor (2013), Meyer et al. (2019) | Empirical measurement instruments and validation |
| **2022-2024** | Storey et al. (2022), Obi et al. (2024), Hicks et al. (2024), Hicks & Hevesi (2024) | Developer experience frameworks, good/bad days, thriving factors |
| **2025** | Context Engineering 2.0, Illusion of Thinking | AI era considerations and limitations |

**Note:** Nonaka (1994) is included as supplementary reference but is not one of the thirteen core sources—the companion notes it as "influential but contested."

**Note:** Bainbridge (1983) is included as supplementary reference providing cognitive engineering grounding for skill degradation and monitoring challenges discussed in collaboration patterns. It is not one of the thirteen core sources but directly supports claims about human-AI collaboration design.

### Companion Document Structure

Each companion analysis follows a consistent structure:

1. **Bibliographic Information** — Full citation, publication venue, quality tier assessment
2. **Source Classification** — Type of work, nature of contribution
3. **Methodology Assessment** — Study design, sample characteristics, analytical approach
4. **Key Findings** — Central claims and evidence
5. **Framework Integration** — Connection to other framework concepts
6. **Limitations and Validation Status** — What's validated, what requires caution

### Excluded Sources

The collection deliberately excludes influential but empirically unsupported concepts:
- "Move fast and break things" (high influence, likely negative outcomes)
- "10x programmer" myth (widely referenced, empirically contested)
- "Technical debt" metaphor (useful framing, rarely measured rigorously)

These exclusions reflect the principle of preferring **falsifiable knowledge** over **appealing narratives**.

### Usage

These papers and analyses serve as the empirical foundation for framework claims. When the framework asserts something about tacit knowledge, developer productivity, or AI limitations, the supporting evidence can be traced back to specific sources with documented methodology and quality assessment.
