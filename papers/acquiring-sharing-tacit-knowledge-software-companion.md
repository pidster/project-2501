## 3. Expected Content Areas

Based on the title and context within the framework, this paper likely addresses:

### Tacit Knowledge Acquisition Mechanisms

**Potential topics:**
- How developers acquire tacit knowledge from colleagues
- Role of social interaction in knowledge acquisition
- Apprenticeship and mentoring mechanisms
- Learning through practice and observation

### Tacit Knowledge Sharing Mechanisms

**Potential topics:**
- How tacit knowledge is transmitted between team members
- Barriers to tacit knowledge sharing
- Practices that facilitate sharing (pairing, review, communities)
- Documentation limitations for tacit knowledge

### Software Development Context

**Specific considerations:**
- Technical tacit knowledge (architectural intuition, coding judgement)
- Process tacit knowledge (estimation, risk assessment)
- Domain tacit knowledge (business context understanding)
- Team coordination tacit knowledge (who knows what)

## 4. Framework Integration Points

### Connection to Naur's Theory-Building

If this paper addresses tacit knowledge acquisition:
- Complements Naur's insight that programming involves theory-building
- May explain mechanisms by which theory transfers (or fails to transfer)
- Could validate or extend claims about documentation insufficiency

### Connection to Wegner's Transactive Memory

If this paper addresses knowledge sharing:
- May provide mechanisms underlying TMS coordination
- Could explain how "who knows what" awareness develops
- Might address how tacit knowledge intersects with explicit coordination

### Connection to Ryan & O'Connor's TTKM

If empirical:
- May use or reference TTKM instrument
- Could provide validation or extension of tacit knowledge measurement
- Might offer additional mechanisms beyond TTKM findings

### Connection to STS Theory

- Tacit knowledge acquisition/sharing is fundamentally socio-technical
- Social structures affect what tacit knowledge can be shared
- Technical artifacts may scaffold or constrain tacit transfer

## 6. Citation Guidance

### Pending Full Review

Until the paper is fully reviewed:
- Cite cautiously with appropriate hedging
- Verify claims against actual paper content
- Confirm publication venue and peer review status

### General Framework Position

This paper likely contributes to understanding:
- How tacit knowledge moves between developers
- What mechanisms enable or inhibit tacit transfer
- Why documentation alone is insufficient (supporting Naur)
- How teams can improve tacit knowledge transmission
