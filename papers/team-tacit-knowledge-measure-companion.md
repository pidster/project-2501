**Authors:**
- Sharon Ryan - University of Greenwich, London, UK
- Rory V. O'Connor - School of Computing, Dublin City University, Dublin, Ireland

**Publication Type:** Empirical research paper (mixed methods)

**Keywords:** Knowledge, Tacit Knowledge, Team Tacit Knowledge, Repertory Grid, Team Performance, Team Management, Agile methods

**Quality Tier: T2** - Empirical research with validated instrument development

**Justification:** Original empirical research with rigorous three-study validation process, develops and validates measurement instrument (TTKM), software development specific, employs mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative), addresses significant measurement challenge in SE, published work (though venue details limited in excerpts). While methodologically sound, smaller sample size (48 teams) and SME focus places it in Tier 2 rather than Tier 1.

## 3. Methodology Assessment

### Overall Design:

**Mixed Methods Sequential Exploratory Approach** (Creswell, 2003):
- Study 1: Qualitative (repertory grid technique)
- Study 2: Quantitative comparison (expert vs. novice)  
- Study 3: Quantitative validation (survey with teams)

### Study 1: Initial Scale Development

**Method:** Repertory Grid Technique
- Based on Kelly's Personal Construct Theory
- Expert project managers elicited constructs
- Content analysis of constructs

**Sample:** Not fully specified in excerpts

**Output:** Initial pool of constructs about tacit knowledge in software teams

**Strengths:**
- Grounded in practitioners' actual knowledge
- Captures knowledge not in formal training
- Domain-specific (software development)
- Theory-driven approach (Kelly's PCT)

**Limitations:**
- Sample size not reported
- Expert selection criteria unclear
- Potential bias from expert selection

### Study 2: Expert-Novice Validation

**Method:** Supplied repertory grids administered to differentiate expertise levels

**Sample:**
- 18 experts (project managers)
- Novices (number not specified in excerpts)

**Analysis:** Expert-novice response differences identified differential items

**Output:** 14 bipolar constructs forming TTKM

**Strengths:**
- Established differential validity
- Follows Wagner & Sternberg practical intelligence approach
- Creates expert profile for scoring

**Limitations:**
- Novice sample size/characteristics unclear
- Definition of "novice" vs "expert" not detailed
- Selection criteria not fully specified

### Study 3: TTKM Validation

**Design:** Online survey of software development teams

**Sample:**

- Age range: 47% in 31-40 age bracket
- Experience: M = 11.64 years (SD = 4.97)
- Team size: 2-12+ members, M = 4.91
- Within-team response rate: 81.86%

**Measures:**

1. **TTKM (14 items)**
   - Bipolar situational judgment test
   - 5-point semantic differential scale
   - Scored via squared Euclidean distance from expert profile

## 6. Known Critiques

### Published Academic Critiques:

**Status:** Limited citations visible in excerpts, but theoretical and methodological critiques can be anticipated:

**Conceptual Critiques:**

1. **Tacit Knowledge Paradox (Gourlay, 2006):**
   - If tacit knowledge cannot be articulated (Polanyi), how can it be measured via questionnaire?
   - TTKM may measure "implicit" rather than truly "tacit" knowledge
   - Distinction between different types of non-explicit knowledge needed

2. **Individual vs. Team-Level Measurement:**
   - Aggregation from individuals may not capture emergent team properties
   - Transactive memory (Wegner) suggests distributed, not shared, knowledge
   - Team tacit knowledge may be qualitatively different from summed individual knowledge

**Methodological Critiques:**

3. **Expert-Novice Approach:**
   - Assumes expert knowledge is always better
   - Context-dependency of expertise
   - Novice knowledge may be valuable in some situations
   - Expert consensus may exclude valuable diversity

4. **Situational Judgment Test Limitations:**
   - May measure judgment about knowledge rather than knowledge itself
   - Hypothetical scenarios vs. actual behavior
   - Social desirability in responses

**Measurement Critiques:**

5. **Limited Predictive Validity:**
   - Only 8% variance explained
   - No efficiency prediction
   - Practical utility questioned
   - Why use TTKM if social interaction explains more?

6. **Construct Coverage:**
   - 14 items may miss important aspects
   - Domain breadth vs. depth trade-off
   - Technical knowledge underrepresented?

### Consistency with Existing Literature:

**Supporting:**
- Aligns with Polanyi (1966) on tacit knowledge importance
- Consistent with Wagner & Sternberg practical intelligence research
- Supports Naur (1985) claims about tacit knowledge in programming
- Complements Wegner (1986) on team knowledge distribution

**Potential Tensions:**
- Gourlay (2006) questions tacit knowledge measurement approaches
- Some research shows explicit documentation effectiveness
- Faraj & Sproull (2000) emphasize expertise coordination over tacit knowledge

### Scholarly Reception:

**Expected Reception:**
- Valuable contribution to operationalizing tacit knowledge
- Fills methodological gap in SE research
- Rigorous development process praised
- Sample size and predictive power limitations noted
- Geographic/organizational scope questioned

**No Major Refutations Identified** (limited visibility of citations in excerpts)

## 7. Potential Biases

### Funding and Conflicts:

**Assessment:** No apparent conflicts
- Academic research from universities
- No commercial interests evident
- No funding sources mentioned in excerpts

### Author Background and Perspective:

**Researchers:**
- Sharon Ryan: University of Greenwich
- Rory V. O'Connor: Dublin City University

**Potential Biases:**

1. **European Academic Context:**
   - Ireland and UK universities
   - European software development practices
   - May favor certain organizational structures
   - Academic vs. industry perspectives

2. **Tacit Knowledge Assumption:**
   - Strong belief in tacit knowledge importance
   - May overstate vs. explicit knowledge
   - Research question assumes tacit knowledge matters
   - Confirmation bias possible

3. **Project Manager Lens:**
   - Experts were project managers
   - Manager perspective vs. developer perspective
   - May emphasize different constructs
   - Power dynamics not examined

### Sample and Selection Biases:

1. **SME Focus:**
   - Small to medium enterprises only
   - Different from startups or large corporations
   - Resource constraints affect practices
   - May select more successful/stable companies

2. **Geographic Bias:**
   - Ireland and UK only
   - Western European cultural context
   - English-speaking
   - Developed economies

3. **Voluntary Participation:**
   - Self-selection into study
   - May favor engaged teams/organizations
   - Struggling teams may not participate
   - Response bias

4. **Gender Imbalance:**
   - 75% male, 25% female
   - Reflects SE demographics but limits generalizability
   - Gender effects not examined

### Measurement and Response Biases:

1. **Expert Selection:**
   - Who defines "expert"?
   - Project manager success criteria
   - May reflect current practices, not ideal
   - Expert consensus may exclude alternatives

2. **Social Desirability:**
   - Teams may overreport positive factors
   - Self-assessment of performance
   - No external validation
   - Halo effects possible

3. **Common Method Variance:**
   - All measures from same survey
   - Same respondents rate TTKM and performance
   - Inflated correlations possible
   - Shared method variance not controlled

### Theoretical and Conceptual Biases:

1. **Cognitive/Individual Focus:**
   - Emphasizes individual knowledge aggregated
   - May underweight structural/organizational factors
   - Limited attention to power, politics, resources
   - Assumes rational knowledge distribution

2. **Performance Assumptions:**
   - Effectiveness and efficiency as outcomes
   - May miss other important outcomes (learning, innovation, satisfaction)
   - Short-term vs. long-term trade-offs
   - Success definition not examined

3. **Measurement Paradigm:**
   - Quantitative measurement assumed possible
   - May not capture full richness of tacit knowledge
   - Reductionist approach to complex phenomenon
   - Qualitative insights may be lost

**Overall Bias Assessment:**
Moderate bias risk from sample characteristics, expert selection, and measurement approach. Biases are typical of SE research and psychometric studies. Geographic and organizational limitations are most significant. The assumption that tacit knowledge can be measured quantitatively is a fundamental paradigm choice that shapes findings.

8. **Practical intelligence approach to tacit knowledge**
   - "Following Wagner and Sternberg's practical intelligence framework, Ryan and O'Connor measured tacit knowledge as expert-novice differences"

**WEAK - Use with substantial caveats:**

9. **Causal claims about tacit knowledge effects**
   - Cross-sectional design prevents causal inference
   - Correlational evidence only

10. **Generalization beyond SMEs or Ireland/UK**
    - Sample limitations require caveats

### Inappropriate Uses:

**DO NOT cite this source for:**

1. **Large organization or enterprise-scale teams**
   - Sample was SMEs, mean team size = 4.91
   - May not apply to teams of 10+, 50+, or 100+

2. **Global or non-Western contexts**
   - Ireland and UK only
   - Cultural factors not examined

3. **Objective performance outcomes**
   - All measures self-reported
   - No code quality, velocity, defect rates, business outcomes

4. **Causal effects of tacit knowledge**
   - Cross-sectional design
   - Cannot establish causation

5. **Tacit knowledge as primary driver of performance**
   - Only 8% variance explained
   - Many other factors more important

6. **Individual-level tacit knowledge**
   - Team-level measure
   - Aggregated from individuals but focused on teams

7. **Technology-specific or modern practices**
   - Publication date unclear
   - No AI, modern tools, distributed work discussion

### Recommended Citation Phrasing:

**Good Examples:**

1. **For measurement contribution:**
   "Ryan and O'Connor developed the Team Tacit Knowledge Measure (TTKM), validated across 48 software development teams in SMEs, providing the first quantitative instrument for assessing team-level tacit knowledge in software engineering."

2. **For empirical findings:**
   "In a study of Irish and UK SME development teams, tacit knowledge correlated significantly with team effectiveness (r=.35, p<.05) and quality of social interaction (r=.45, p<.01), explaining 8% of effectiveness variance beyond explicit knowledge (Ryan & O'Connor)."

3. **For discriminant validity:**
   "The TTKM successfully discriminated tacit from explicit knowledge, showing no significant correlation with reliance on or familiarity with written procedures (Ryan & O'Connor), supporting Polanyi's conceptual distinction."

4. **For methodology:**
   "Using repertory grid technique and expert-novice differentiation, Ryan and O'Connor operationalized tacit knowledge as 14 bipolar constructs differentiating successful from unsuccessful project factors."

5. **With appropriate caveats:**
   "While Ryan and O'Connor provided the first validated measure of team tacit knowledge in software development, their findings from 48 SME teams in Ireland and the UK require validation in larger organizations and diverse cultural contexts."

**Poor Examples (avoid):**

1. âŒ "Ryan and O'Connor proved that tacit knowledge is the primary driver of team performance"
   - (Only 8% variance explained; "proved" too strong; not primary)

2. âŒ "The TTKM is validated globally for all software teams"
   - (Ireland/UK only; SMEs only; not globally validated)

3. âŒ "Research by Ryan and O'Connor shows tacit knowledge causes higher team effectiveness"
   - (Cross-sectional; correlational; cannot claim causation)

4. âŒ "Ryan and O'Connor demonstrated that explicit knowledge doesn't matter for performance"
   - (Discriminant validity doesn't mean explicit knowledge is unimportant)

5. âŒ "The TTKM should be used to evaluate all software development teams"
   - (Research instrument; limited predictive power; context-specific)

### Required Caveats When Citing:

**Always include:**

1. **Note SME and geographic context**
   - "In Irish and UK SMEs..."
   - "Among small development teams (M=4.91)..."

2. **Acknowledge correlational nature**
   - "Correlational evidence suggests..."
   - "Cross-sectional findings indicate..."

**Context-specific caveats:**

- **For predictive claims:** Note 8% variance explained
- **For generalization:** Specify SME, Ireland/UK limitations
- **For causal language:** Clarify correlational design
- **For measurement:** Note self-report nature
- **For team size:** Specify small teams (mean ~5 members)

**Example with full caveats:**
"Ryan and O'Connor developed and validated the Team Tacit Knowledge Measure (TTKM) across 48 small software development teams (M=4.91 members) in Irish and UK SMEs, finding that team tacit knowledge correlated with effectiveness (r=.35) and explained 8% of variance beyond social interaction, though the cross-sectional design and geographic scope limit causal inference and generalizability."

## Additional Notes

### Methodological Contributions:

**To Software Engineering:**
- First validated team-level tacit knowledge measure in SE
- Demonstrates repertory grid applicability to SE research
- Expert-novice differentiation approach for SE constructs
- Psychometric validation model for SE instruments

**To Knowledge Management:**
- Operationalization of tacit knowledge at team level
- Discriminant validity from explicit knowledge
- Social interaction as mechanism empirically supported
- Domain-specific measurement approach

### Key Strengths:

1. **Rigorous Three-Study Design:** Qualitative â†’ Quantitative â†’ Validation
2. **Software-Specific:** Not general psychology, but SE context
3. **Team-Level Focus:** Addresses aggregation statistically
4. **Psychometric Validation:** Multiple validity types assessed
5. **Expert-Grounded:** Constructs from practitioners, not just theory
6. **Discriminant Validity:** Successfully distinguishes tacit from explicit
7. **Performance Link:** Empirical connection to effectiveness

### Key Limitations to Remember:

1. **Small Sample:** 48 teams limits statistical power and generalizability
2. **SME Focus:** Small-medium enterprises, not large organizations
3. **Geographic Limitation:** Ireland and UK only
4. **Cross-Sectional:** Single time point, no causality
5. **Self-Report:** All measures subjective, no objective metrics
6. **Limited Prediction:** Only 8% variance in effectiveness
7. **No Efficiency:** Didn't predict efficiency, only effectiveness

### Practical Implications:

**For Organizations:**
- Tacit knowledge can be assessed systematically
- Social interaction important for knowledge diffusion
- Focus on effectiveness (quality) may differ from efficiency (speed)
- Expert judgment can guide team design

**For Researchers:**
- Repertory grid technique viable for SE constructs
- Expert-novice differentiation useful for validation
- Team-level measurement requires aggregation justification
- Multiple validity types essential

**For Tool Developers:**
- Understanding team tacit knowledge informs tool design
- Social features may facilitate tacit knowledge sharing
- Documentation (explicit) complements but doesn't replace tacit
- Team collaboration tools should support knowledge exchange

### Future Research Directions:

**Suggested by Authors:**
- Larger sample validation
- Longitudinal studies of knowledge development
- Intervention studies testing knowledge practices
- Different organizational contexts (large enterprises)
- Cross-cultural validation

**Implied by Limitations:**
- AI effects on team tacit knowledge
- Phase-specific tacit knowledge measurement
- Individual vs. team-level dynamics
- Objective performance validation
- Large-scale team applications
