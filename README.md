# Project 2501

An AI-Augmented Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Framework grounded in empirical research and theoretical foundations.

## Overview

This project develops a comprehensive framework for integrating AI capabilities into software development while preserving the tacit knowledge and theory-building that determine project success. The framework synthesises 70+ years of research spanning socio-technical systems theory (1951), cognitive theory (1985), and contemporary developer experience research (2024-2025).

## Core Thesis

Software development is fundamentally about building shared mental models ("theories") in developers' minds, with 70-80% of software knowledge being tacit rather than documented. This has profound implications for AI integration:

1. **Different phases require different approaches** — Early phases are tacit-heavy and require human leadership; later phases are formal-heavy and enable greater AI autonomy
2. **Joint optimisation is essential** — Human-AI work systems require socio-technical design, not just AI tool adoption
3. **Theory-building remains human** — Current AI systems generate artefacts without developing the explanatory understanding that enables intelligent system evolution
