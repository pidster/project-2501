# Dialogue Framework

An AI-augmented software development lifecycle framework that leverages dialogue, decisions, and observations to enhance project outcomes.

## Overview

This Claude Code plugin provides skills and agents for maintaining structured logs of decisions and observations during software development work. These logs create an audit trail that supports:

- **Traceability**: Understanding why decisions were made
- **Knowledge preservation**: Capturing tacit knowledge as it emerges
- **Compliance verification**: Ensuring required documentation occurs

## Installation

### Development (self-hosted)

Run Claude Code with the plugin directory:

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./plugin
```

### Production

Copy the `plugin/` directory to your Claude Code plugins location or install from marketplace (when published).

## Commands

User-invoked commands for explicit actions.

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/init-dialogue` | Initialise framework for a project (creates `.dialogue/` directory) |
| `/create-theory` | Create THY document (integrated understanding, the "why") |
| `/create-reference` | Create REF document (catalogues, glossaries, explainers) |
| `/create-strategy` | Create STR document (decisions, rationale, business cases) |
| `/create-note` | Create NOT document (ephemeral notes, workshop outputs) |
| `/help` | Get help with the framework, list commands, explain concepts |

## Skills

### Core Logging Skills

#### dialogue-log-decision

Log decisions to a chronological decision log. Supports four decision types:

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| OPERATIONAL | Routine choices during task execution |
| TACTICAL | Approach changes affecting method |
| DESIGN | Component/schema decisions with rationale |
| ADR | Cross-reference to Architecture Decision Record |

**Triggers**: "log decision", "record decision", "document choice"

#### dialogue-log-observation

Log observations (measurements, states, events) to an observation log.

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| MEASUREMENT | Quantitative data |
| STATE | System/process state |
| EVENT | Occurrences |

**Triggers**: "log observation", "record observation", "note finding", "capture state"

#### dialogue-create-adr

Create Architecture Decision Records for significant architectural decisions requiring formal alternatives analysis.

**Triggers**: "create ADR", "make ADR", "record architecture decision", "formal alternatives analysis"

### Supporting Skills

#### dialogue-resolve-reference

Resolve framework reference IDs (THY-001, DEC-..., ADR-001, etc.) to their content.

**Triggers**: "resolve reference", "look up THY-001", "find DEC-...", "what is ADR-001"

#### dialogue-structured-elicit

Gather structured information through framework-aware questioning.

**Triggers**: "gather requirements", "elicit context", "structured questions", "need to understand"

#### dialogue-verify-logging-compliance

Verify that required logging occurred during process execution.

**Triggers**: "verify logging", "check compliance", "validate logs"

#### dialogue-manage-work-items

Manage persistent work items in `.dialogue/work-items.yaml`. Guidance-only skill for direct YAML editing.

**Triggers**: "create work item", "update work item", "manage work items", "track work"

### Document Creation Skills

These skills activate autonomously and reference their corresponding commands for implementation.

#### dialogue-create-theory

Create Theory (THY) documents capturing integrated understanding.

**Triggers**: "capture theory", "document understanding", "write theory", "explain why this works"

#### dialogue-create-reference

Create Reference (REF) documents for catalogues, glossaries, and explainers.

**Triggers**: "create reference", "document concepts", "make glossary", "catalogue these"

#### dialogue-create-strategy

Create Strategy (STR) documents for decisions and rationale.

**Triggers**: "document strategy", "record strategic decision", "capture rationale"

#### dialogue-create-note

Create Note (NOT) documents for ephemeral process artefacts.

**Triggers**: "capture notes", "document meeting", "record workshop", "save analysis"

### Help Skill

#### dialogue-help

Provide contextual help and orientation for the Dialogue Framework.

**Triggers**: "how does dialogue work", "what commands", "explain phases", "framework help"

## Agents

### Process Architect

Designs capability flow specifications for SDLC processes following the AI-Augmented SDLC Framework.

**Use when**: Analysing or creating process definitions with human-AI collaboration patterns.

**Collaboration pattern**: Partnership — human provides context and approves; AI applies framework knowledge and drafts specifications.

**Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, AskUserQuestion

## Hooks

### PreToolUse: auto-approve-framework

Auto-approves Bash commands that run known-safe framework scripts, eliminating permission prompts for routine operations.

**Approved scripts:**
- `dialogue-log-decision/scripts/log-decision.sh`
- `dialogue-log-observation/scripts/log-observation.sh`
- `dialogue-resolve-reference/scripts/resolve-reference.sh`
- `dialogue-create-adr/scripts/create-adr.sh`

**Behaviour:** Returns `permissionDecision: "allow"` for approved scripts. Silent for other commands (normal permission flow).

### SessionStart: check-dialogue-init

Checks if the Dialogue Framework is initialised when a session starts. Reports status to help Claude guide the user.

### UserPromptSubmit: framework-context

Detects framework-relevant patterns in user prompts and injects minimal signal tags. These signals help Claude recognise when to invoke framework components without verbose instructions.

**Signals emitted:**

| Signal | Detected Pattern | Related Component |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| `decision-capture` | "I decided", "let's go with", etc. | `dialogue-log-decision` |
| `observation-capture` | "I noticed", "I observed", etc. | `dialogue-log-observation` |
| `work-item-context` | `SH-NNN`, `FW-NNN`, `CD-NNN` | `dialogue-manage-work-items` |
| `work-item-candidate` | "implement feature", "investigate issue", etc. | See triage below |
| `resolve-reference` | `THY-NNN`, `REF-NNN`, `DEC-*`, etc. | `dialogue-resolve-reference` |
| `phase-1` to `phase-5` | Phase keywords | Phase-specific guidance |
| `create-adr` | "create ADR", "architecture decision" | `dialogue-create-adr` |
| `structured-elicit` | "elicit knowledge", "gather context" | `dialogue-structured-elicit` |

**Output format:** `<dialogue-signals>signal1 signal2</dialogue-signals>`

**Behaviour:** Silent when no framework relevance detected.

**Signal interpretation for Claude:**

When you see `<dialogue-signals>` in context, consider invoking the related component:

- `decision-capture` → After responding, use `dialogue-log-decision` skill to log the decision
- `observation-capture` → After responding, use `dialogue-log-observation` skill to log the observation
- `work-item-context` → Resolve the work item ID to provide context
- `work-item-candidate` → Triage: session todo vs project work item (see below)
- `resolve-reference` → Use `dialogue-resolve-reference` skill to look up the reference
- `phase-N` → Apply phase-specific guidance from framework manual
- `create-adr` → Use `dialogue-create-adr` skill for formal architecture decision
- `structured-elicit` → Use `dialogue-structured-elicit` skill for systematic questioning

Signals indicate *relevance*, not obligation. Use judgement about whether the component is actually needed.

**Work item candidate triage:**

When you see `work-item-candidate`, determine if the request is:

| Type | Characteristics | Action |
|------|-----------------|--------|
| **Session todo** | Quick task, single session, tactical | Use `TodoWrite` tool |
| **Project work item** | Persistent, multi-session, strategic | Use `dialogue-manage-work-items` skill |

Triage questions:
1. Is this already tracked in `.dialogue/work-items.yaml`? → Use existing item
2. Will this span multiple sessions or require ongoing tracking? → Project work item
3. Is this part of the project roadmap or backlog? → Project work item
4. Is this a quick fix or one-off task? → Session todo

When uncertain, default to session todo. Project work items should be deliberate.

## Requirements

- Claude Code with plugin support
- Project must have `.dialogue/logs/` directory (created automatically)

## Environment Variables

The plugin uses Claude Code's built-in environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` | Project root for log file storage |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` | Plugin installation directory |

## Log File Locations

Logs are written to the project directory:

- Decisions: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.dialogue/logs/decisions.yaml`
- Observations: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.dialogue/logs/observations.yaml`
- Work items: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.dialogue/work-items.yaml`
- ADRs: `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/decisions/ADR-NNN-*.md`

## Part of the AI-Augmented SDLC Framework

This plugin is the delivery mechanism for the framework's dialogue and process design capabilities. For full framework documentation, see the [project repository](https://github.com/pidster/project-2501).
